  "summary": "The `IOUtils` file is part of the Alephium project and contains utility functions for handling input/output (IO) operations. The file is written in Scala and imports several classes from the Java standard library. \n\nThe `createDirUnsafe` function takes a `Path` object and creates a directory at that path if it does not already exist. If the directory already exists, the function does nothing. \n\nThe `clearUnsafe` function takes a `Path` object and deletes all files and directories within that path. If the path does not exist or is not a directory, the function does nothing. \n\nThe `removeUnsafe` function takes a `Path` object and deletes that file or directory. If the path is a directory, the function recursively deletes all files and directories within that path. If the path does not exist, the function does nothing. \n\nThe `tryExecute` function takes a block of code `f` and executes it, returning an `IOResult` object. If the block of code executes successfully, the function returns a `Right` object containing the result of the block. If the block of code throws an exception, the function catches the exception and returns a `Left` object containing an `IOError` object that describes the type of error that occurred. \n\nThe `tryExecuteF` function is similar to `tryExecute`, but takes a block of code that returns an `IOResult` object instead of a regular value. If the block of code executes successfully, the function returns the result of the block. If the block of code throws an exception, the function catches the exception and returns a `Left` object containing an `IOError` object that describes the type of error that occurred. \n\nThe `error` function is a partial function that matches on several types of exceptions that may be thrown by the `tryExecute` and `tryExecuteF` functions. If the exception matches one of the specified types, the function returns a `Left` object containing an `IOError` object that describes the type of error that occurred. \n\nOverall, the `IOUtils` file provides several utility functions for handling IO operations in the Alephium project. These functions may be used by other parts of the project to create directories, delete files and directories, and execute blocks of code that may throw IO-related exceptions.",
  "questions": "1.
