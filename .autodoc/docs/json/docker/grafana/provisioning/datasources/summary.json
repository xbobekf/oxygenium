      "summary": "This code is a configuration file for the Alephium project that specifies the version of the API and provides a list of datasources to be deleted from the database, as well as a list of datasources to be inserted or updated depending on what is available in the database. \n\nThe `deleteDatasources` section specifies a list of datasources that should be deleted from the database. In this case, there is only one datasource named \"Prometheus\" with an orgId of 1. \n\nThe `datasources` section specifies a list of datasources to be inserted or updated. Each datasource is defined by a set of key-value pairs. The `name` and `type` fields are required, with `name` specifying the name of the datasource and `type` specifying the type of datasource (in this case, \"prometheus\"). The `access` field specifies the access mode, which can be either \"direct\" or \"proxy\". \n\nOther optional fields include `orgId`, `url`, `password`, `user`, `database`, `basicAuth`, `basicAuthUser`, `basicAuthPassword`, `withCredentials`, `isDefault`, `jsonData`, `secureJsonData`, `version`, and `editable`. These fields provide additional configuration options for the datasource, such as specifying the database URL, enabling basic authentication, and allowing users to edit the datasource from the UI. \n\nOverall, this configuration file allows the Alephium project to manage its datasources in a flexible and customizable way. For example, if a new datasource is added to the database, it can be automatically inserted into the configuration file and made available to the project without requiring manual configuration. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n# Load the configuration file\nconfig = load_config_file('alephium.yml')\n\n# Get the list of datasources to delete\ndelete_list = config['deleteDatasources']\n\n# Get the list of datasources to insert/update\ndatasources = config['datasources']\n\n# Loop through the datasources and perform the necessary actions\nfor datasource in datasources:\n    if datasource in delete_list:\n        delete_datasource(datasource)\n    else:\n        insert_or_update_datasource(datasource)\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n    \n    This code file is a configuration file for a project called alephium. It specifies a list of datasources to be deleted and a list of datasources to be inserted or updated in the database.\n\n2. What is the format of the datasources list?\n    \n    The datasources list is a YAML list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a datasource and contains various properties such as name, type, access mode, URL, and authentication information.\n\n3. What is the significance of the isDefault property?\n    \n    The isDefault property is a boolean value that indicates whether a datasource should be marked as the default datasource for the organization. Only one datasource can be marked as default per organization."

  "summary": "The `datasource.yml` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/docker/grafana/provisioning/datasources` folder is a configuration file for managing datasources in the Alephium project. It specifies the API version and provides a list of datasources to be deleted from the database, as well as a list of datasources to be inserted or updated depending on their availability in the database.\n\nThe file is divided into two main sections: `deleteDatasources` and `datasources`. The `deleteDatasources` section lists the datasources that should be removed from the database. In this case, there is only one datasource named \"Prometheus\" with an orgId of 1.\n\nThe `datasources` section lists the datasources to be inserted or updated. Each datasource is defined by a set of key-value pairs, with the `name` and `type` fields being required. The `name` field specifies the datasource's name, while the `type` field specifies its type (e.g., \"prometheus\"). The `access` field indicates the access mode, which can be either \"direct\" or \"proxy\".\n\nAdditional optional fields provide further configuration options for the datasource, such as specifying the database URL, enabling basic authentication, and allowing users to edit the datasource from the UI. These fields include `orgId`, `url`, `password`, `user`, `database`, `basicAuth`, `basicAuthUser`, `basicAuthPassword`, `withCredentials`, `isDefault`, `jsonData`, `secureJsonData`, `version`, and `editable`.\n\nThis configuration file enables the Alephium project to manage its datasources flexibly and customizably. For instance, if a new datasource is added to the database, it can be automatically inserted into the configuration file and made available to the project without requiring manual configuration.\n\nHere's an example of how this code might be used:\n\n```python\n# Load the configuration file\nconfig = load_config_file('alephium.yml')\n\n# Get the list of datasources to delete\ndelete_list = config['deleteDatasources']\n\n# Get the list of datasources to insert/update\ndatasources = config['datasources']\n\n# Loop through the datasources and perform the necessary actions\nfor datasource in datasources:\n    if datasource in delete_list:\n        delete_datasource(datasource)\n    else:\n        insert_or_update_datasource(datasource)\n```\n\nIn this example, the configuration file is loaded, and the lists of datasources to delete and insert/update are retrieved. The code then iterates through the datasources, deleting those in the delete list and inserting or updating the others as needed. This allows for efficient and flexible management of datasources within the Alephium project.",
