The Oxygenium blockchain explorer is a tool that allows users to view and analyze data on the Oxygenium blockchain network. \n\nThe docker-compose file defines three services: postgres, explorer-backend, and explorer. \n\nThe postgres service is a PostgreSQL database that stores data related to the Oxygenium blockchain. The volumes section defines a named volume called postgres-data that is used to persist the data stored in the database. The environment section sets the username, password, and database name for the PostgreSQL instance. \n\nThe explorer-backend service is the backend component of the Oxygenium blockchain explorer. It is responsible for retrieving data from the Oxygenium blockchain and storing it in the PostgreSQL database. The image section specifies the Docker image to use for this service. The ports section maps port 9090 on the host machine to port 9090 in the container. The environment section sets the hostnames for the PostgreSQL database, the Oxygenium blockchain node, and the explorer-backend service itself. The depends_on section specifies that this service depends on the postgres and oxygenium services. \n\nThe explorer service is the frontend component of the Oxygenium blockchain explorer. It is responsible for displaying data from the PostgreSQL database to the user. The image section specifies the Docker image to use for this service.

      "summary": "The `prometheus.yml` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/docker/prometheus` folder is a configuration file for the Prometheus monitoring and alerting system. It is specifically tailored for the Oxygenium project, allowing developers to monitor the performance and health of the Oxygenium application.\n\nThe configuration file consists of two main sections: `global` and `scrape_configs`. The `global` section sets the default scrape interval and evaluation interval to 15 seconds, which means that Prometheus will collect data from the target every 15 seconds. It also sets an external label named 'oxygenium' for all time series and alerts, making it easier to identify the source of the data.\n\nThe `scrape_configs` section defines the job name as 'oxygenium' and sets the scrape interval to 15 seconds, which is the same as the global default. The `static_configs` section within `scrape_configs` specifies the target to be scraped, which is the Oxygenium application running on port 12973. Additionally, it adds a label 'app' with the value 'oxygenium' to all scraped time series and alerts, further categorizing the collected data.\n\nThis configuration file is essential for integrating Prometheus with the Oxygenium project. By using this file, developers can set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Oxygenium application at the defined interval and store them in a time series database. These metrics can then be visualized and analyzed using Prometheus' built-in query language, or used to trigger alerts based on predefined rules.\n\nTo use this configuration file in the Oxygenium project, follow the example below:\n\n```bash\n# Start Prometheus with the oxygenium.yml configuration file\nprometheus --config.file=oxygenium.yml\n\n# Access the Prometheus web UI to view metrics and alerts\nhttp://localhost:9090/\n```\n\nBy following these steps, developers can monitor the Oxygenium application's performance and health, allowing them to identify potential issues and optimize the application accordingly.",

The Oxygenium project is a blockchain platform that allows for the creation of decentralized applications. The purpose of this Dockerfile is to create a container that can run the Oxygenium node software.\n\nThe Dockerfile starts by pulling the `eclipse-temurin:17-jre` image, which is a Java runtime environment. It then sets an argument called `RELEASE` to `0.0.0`. This argument is used later in the Dockerfile to download the Oxygenium node software.\n\nThe next step is to download the Oxygenium node software from GitHub. This is done using the `curl` command, which downloads the software and saves it as `/oxygenium.jar`. The `mkdir` command is then used to create a directory called `/oxygenium-home`, which is used to store the Oxygenium node data. The `usermod` and `chown` commands are used to set the owner of the `/oxygenium-home` directory to `nobody`, which is a non-root user. The `mkdir` command is then used to create two directories called `~nobody/.oxygenium` and `~nobody/.oxygenium-wallets`, which are used to store the Oxygenium node configuration and wallet data, respectively. The `chown` command is used to set the owner of these directories to `nobody`.\n\nThe `COPY` command is then used to copy two files into the container. The first file is called `user-mainnet-release.conf` and is copied to `/oxygenium-home/.oxygenium/user.conf`. This file contains the configuration settings for the Oxygenium node. The second file is called `entrypoint.sh` and is copied to the root directory of the container. This file is used as the entrypoint for the container.\n\nThe `EXPOSE` command is used to expose four ports: `12973` for HTTP, `11973` for WebSocket, `10973` for the miner, and `9973` for P2P communication.\n\nThe `VOLUME` command is used to create two volumes: `/oxygenium-home/.oxygenium` and `/oxygenium-home/.oxygenium-wallets`. These volumes are used to store the Oxygenium node data and wallet data, respectively.\n\nThe `USER` command is used to set the user to `nobody`.\n\nThe `ENV` command is used to set three environment variables: `JAVA_NET_OPTS`, `JAVA_MEM_OPTS`, and `JAVA_GC_OPTS`. These variables are used to configure the Java runtime environment.\n\nFinally, the `ENTRYPOINT` command is used to set the entrypoint for the container to `/entrypoint.sh`.\n\nOverall, this Dockerfile is used to build a container that can run the Oxygenium node software. The container is configured to use a non-root user and to store the Oxygenium node data and wallet data in volumes.
