The Alephium blockchain explorer is a tool that allows users to view and analyze data on the Alephium blockchain network. \n\nThe docker-compose file defines three services: postgres, explorer-backend, and explorer. \n\nThe postgres service is a PostgreSQL database that stores data related to the Alephium blockchain.

      "summary": "The `prometheus.yml` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/docker/prometheus` folder is a configuration file for the Prometheus monitoring and alerting system. It is specifically tailored for the Alephium project, allowing developers to monitor the performance and health of the Alephium application.\n\nThe configuration file consists of two main sections: `global` and `scrape_configs`. The `global` section sets the default scrape interval and evaluation interval to 15 seconds, which means that Prometheus will collect data from the target every 15 seconds. It also sets an external label named 'alephium' for all time series and alerts, making it easier to identify the source of the data.\n\nThe `scrape_configs` section defines the job name as 'alephium' and sets the scrape interval to 15 seconds, which is the same as the global default. The `static_configs` section within `scrape_configs` specifies the target to be scraped, which is the Alephium application running on port 12973. Additionally, it adds a label 'app' with the value 'alephium' to all scraped time series and alerts, further categorizing the collected data.\n\nThis configuration file is essential for integrating Prometheus with the Alephium project. By using this file, developers can set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Alephium application at the defined interval and store them in a time series database. These metrics can then be visualized and analyzed using Prometheus' built-in query language, or used to trigger alerts based on predefined rules.\n\nTo use this configuration file in the Alephium project, follow the example below:\n\n```bash\n# Start Prometheus with the alephium.yml configuration file\nprometheus --config.file=alephium.yml\n\n# Access the Prometheus web UI to view metrics and alerts\nhttp://localhost:9090/\n```\n\nBy following these steps, developers can monitor the Alephium application's performance and health, allowing them to identify potential issues and optimize the application accordingly.",

          "summary": "This Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for the Alephium project. The Alephium project is a blockchain platform that allows for the creation of decentralized applications. The purpose of this Dockerfile is to create a container that can run the Alephium node software.\n\nThe Dockerfile starts by pulling the `eclipse-temurin:17-jre` image, which is a Java runtime environment. It then sets an argument called `RELEASE` to `0.0.0`. This argument is used later in the Dockerfile to download the Alephium node software.\n\nThe next step is to download the Alephium node software from GitHub. This is done using the `curl` command, which downloads the software and saves it as `/alephium.jar`. The `mkdir` command is then used to create a directory called `/alephium-home`, which is used to store the Alephium node data. The `usermod` and `chown` commands are used to set the owner of the `/alephium-home` directory to `nobody`, which is a non-root user. The `mkdir` command is then used to create two directories called `~nobody/.alephium` and `~nobody/.alephium-wallets`, which are used to store the Alephium node configuration and wallet data, respectively. The `chown` command is used to set the owner of these directories to `nobody`.\n\nThe `COPY` command is then used to copy two files into the container. The first file is called `user-mainnet-release.conf` and is copied to `/alephium-home/.alephium/user.conf`. This file contains the configuration settings for the Alephium node. The second file is called `entrypoint.sh` and is copied to the root directory of the container. This file is used as the entrypoint for the container.\n\nThe `EXPOSE` command is used to expose four ports: `12973` for HTTP, `11973` for WebSocket, `10973` for the miner, and `9973` for P2P communication.\n\nThe `VOLUME` command is used to create two volumes: `/alephium-home/.alephium` and `/alephium-home/.alephium-wallets`. These volumes are used to store the Alephium node data and wallet data, respectively.\n\nThe `USER` command is used to set the user to `nobody`.\n\nThe `ENV` command is used to set three environment variables: `JAVA_NET_OPTS`, `JAVA_MEM_OPTS`, and `JAVA_GC_OPTS`. These variables are used to configure the Java runtime environment.\n\nFinally, the `ENTRYPOINT` command is used to set the entrypoint for the container to `/entrypoint.sh`.\n\nOverall, this Dockerfile is used to build a container that can run the Alephium node software. The container is configured to use a non-root user and to store the Alephium node data and wallet data in volumes.

What is the significance of the exposed ports?\n   \n   The exposed ports are used by the Alephium network to communicate with other nodes and miners. Port 12973 is used for HTTP communication, port 11973 is used for WebSocket communication, port 10973 is used for miner communication, and port 9973 is used for peer-to-peer communication."

The Dockerfile also copies a configuration file (`user-mainnet-release.conf`) to the `nobody` user's home directory, which is used to configure the Alephium binary at runtime. \n\nThe Dockerfile exposes several ports that the Alephium binary uses to communicate with other nodes on the network. These ports include `12973` for HTTP, `11973` for WebSocket, `10973` for the miner, and `9973` for P2P communication. \n\nThe Dockerfile also sets up two volumes for the `nobody` user's home directory, one for the Alephium data directory (`/alephium-home/.alephium`) and one for the Alephium wallets directory (`/alephium-home/.alephium-wallets`). These volumes allow the user to persist data and wallets across container restarts. \n\nFinally, the Dockerfile sets several environment variables (`JAVA_NET_OPTS`, `JAVA_MEM_OPTS`, `JAVA_GC_OPTS`, and `JAVA_EXTRA_OPTS`) that can be used to configure the Java runtime environment that the Alephium binary runs in. \n\nOverall, this Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image that can be used to run an Alephium node.
