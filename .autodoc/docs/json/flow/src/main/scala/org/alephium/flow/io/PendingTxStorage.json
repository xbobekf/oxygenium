  "summary": "This code defines a trait and a class for storing and managing pending transactions in a RocksDB database. The trait `PendingTxStorage` extends the `KeyValueStorage` trait and defines additional methods for iterating over the stored transactions and replacing a transaction with a new one. The `PendingTxRocksDBStorage` class extends the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class and implements the `PendingTxStorage` trait. It also defines a `replace` method that removes the old transaction and inserts the new one with the same transaction ID.\n\nThe `PendingTxStorage` trait defines the following methods:\n- `iterateE`: iterates over the stored transactions and applies a function that returns an `IOResult` for each transaction.\n- `iterate`: iterates over the stored transactions and applies a function that does not return a value for each transaction.\n- `replace`: replaces a stored transaction with a new one that has the same transaction ID.\n- `size`: returns the number of stored transactions.\n\nThe `PendingTxRocksDBStorage` class defines a constructor that takes a `RocksDBSource` object, a column family, and read and write options. It also defines the `replace` method that removes the old transaction and inserts the new one with the same transaction ID. The `removeUnsafe` and `putUnsafe` methods are inherited from the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class and are used to remove and insert transactions in the database.\n\nThis code is used to store and manage pending transactions in the Alephium project. It provides an interface for adding, removing, and iterating over transactions in a RocksDB database. The `PendingTxRocksDBStorage` class can be instantiated with different column families to store different types of transactions. For example, the project may use different column families for different types of transactions, such as regular transactions, contract transactions, and governance transactions. The `PendingTxStorage` trait can be used as a common interface for managing all types of pending transactions. Here is an example of how to use this code to store and retrieve a transaction:\n\n```scala\nval storage = PendingTxRocksDBStorage(...)\nval txId = PersistedTxId(...)\nval tx = TransactionTemplate(...)\nstorage.put(txId, tx)\nval retrievedTx = storage.get(txId)\n```",
