  "summary": "The code defines a set of utility functions that can be used across the Alephium project. These functions are designed to help with displaying various types of data in a human-readable format. \n\nThe `showDigest` function takes a vector of `RandomBytes` objects and returns a string representation of the vector. If the vector is empty, it returns `\"[]\"`. Otherwise, it returns a string containing the short hexadecimal representation of the first and last elements of the vector, separated by `\"..\"` and enclosed in square brackets. For example, `showDigest(AVector(RandomBytes(1), RandomBytes(2), RandomBytes(3)))` would return `\"[ 01..03 ]\"`.\n\nThe `showTxs` function takes a vector of `TransactionTemplate` objects and returns a string representation of the vector. If the vector is empty, it returns `\"[]\"`. Otherwise, it returns a string containing the short hexadecimal representation of the IDs of the first and last transactions in the vector, separated by `\"..\"` and enclosed in square brackets. For example, `showTxs(AVector(TransactionTemplate(TransactionId(1)), TransactionTemplate(TransactionId(2)), TransactionTemplate(TransactionId(3))))` would return `\"[ 01..03 ]\"`.\n\nThe `showFlow` function takes a vector of vectors of `RandomBytes` objects and returns a string representation of the vector. It does this by mapping the `showDigest` function over each inner vector and then joining the resulting strings with `\", \"`. For example, `showFlow(AVector(AVector(RandomBytes(1), RandomBytes(2)), AVector(RandomBytes(3), RandomBytes(4)))))` would return `\"[ [ 01..02 ], [ 03..04 ] ]\"`.\n\nThe `showDataDigest` function takes a vector of `FlowData` objects and returns a string representation of the vector. If the vector is empty, it returns `\"[]\"`. Otherwise, it returns a string containing the short hexadecimal representation of the first and last elements of the vector, separated by `\"..\"` and enclosed in square brackets. For example, `showDataDigest(AVector(FlowData(1), FlowData(2), FlowData(3)))` would return `\"[ 01..03 ]\"`.\n\nThe `showChainIndexedDigest` function takes a vector of pairs of `ChainIndex` and vectors of `TransactionId` objects and returns a string representation of the vector. It does this by mapping a function that combines the `ChainIndex` and the result of calling `showDigest` on the corresponding vector of `TransactionId` objects over each pair and then joining the resulting strings with `\", \"`. For example, `showChainIndexedDigest(AVector((ChainIndex(1), AVector(TransactionId(1), TransactionId(2))), (ChainIndex(2), AVector(TransactionId(3), TransactionId(4))))` would return `\"[ 1 -> [ 01..02 ], 2 -> [ 03..04 ] ]\"`.\n\nThe `unsafe` function takes an `IOResult` object and returns the value contained in it if it is a `Right` object. If it is a `Left` object, it throws the exception contained in it. This function is used to extract the value from an `IOResult` object when it is known that the operation that produced the object will not fail.",
