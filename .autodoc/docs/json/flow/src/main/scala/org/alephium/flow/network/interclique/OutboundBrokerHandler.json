  "summary": "This code defines a class called `OutboundBrokerHandler` and an object called `OutboundBrokerHandler` in the `org.alephium.flow.network.interclique` package. The purpose of this code is to handle outbound connections to other brokers in the Alephium network. \n\nThe `OutboundBrokerHandler` class extends `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler` and implements the `BrokerHandler` trait. It takes in several parameters including `selfCliqueInfo`, `expectedRemoteBroker`, `blockflow`, `allHandlers`, `cliqueManager`, and `blockFlowSynchronizer`. These parameters are used to initialize the class and are passed in through the `props` method defined in the `OutboundBrokerHandler` object. \n\nThe `OutboundBrokerHandler` class overrides the `handleHandshakeInfo` method defined in `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler`. This method is called when a handshake message is received from the remote broker. If the `remoteBrokerInfo` received in the handshake message matches the `expectedRemoteBroker` passed in as a parameter, the `super.handleHandshakeInfo` method is called. Otherwise, the method logs a debug message and stops the actor. \n\nThe `OutboundBrokerHandler` object defines a `props` method that takes in the same parameters as the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class and returns a `Props` object that can be used to create an instance of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class. \n\nThis code is used in the larger Alephium project to manage outbound connections to other brokers in the network. It ensures that the remote broker has the expected broker info before allowing the connection to proceed. This helps to maintain the integrity of the network and prevent malicious actors from joining. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nval outboundBrokerHandler = system.actorOf(\n  OutboundBrokerHandler.props(\n    selfCliqueInfo,\n    remoteBroker,\n    blockflow,\n    allHandlers,\n    cliqueManager,\n    blockFlowSynchronizer\n  )\n)\n```",
