  "summary": "The `DiscoveryServerState` trait in this code is responsible for managing the state of the Alephium network's discovery server. It maintains a table of known peers, their statuses, and unreachable peers. The discovery server is responsible for finding and maintaining connections with other peers in the network, which is essential for the proper functioning of the Alephium blockchain.\n\nThe `DiscoveryServerState` trait provides methods for managing the peer table, such as adding, updating, and removing peers. It also provides methods for managing unreachable peers, such as marking them as unreachable or removing them from the list of unreachable peers. Additionally, it provides methods for fetching neighbors and sending messages to peers.\n\nThe `SessionManager` trait is responsible for managing sessions with other peers. It maintains a cache of pending sessions and provides methods for creating new sessions, validating session IDs, and cleaning up expired sessions.\n\nThese traits are used by the larger Alephium project to manage the state of the discovery server and maintain connections with other peers in the network. For example, the `scan()` method in `DiscoveryServerState` is used to ping peer candidates and bootstrap nodes to discover new peers. The `handlePong()` method is used to process Pong messages from other peers, updating their status in the peer table or adding them if they are not already in the table.\n\nHere's an example of how the `DiscoveryServerState` trait might be used to send a Ping message to a peer:\n\n```scala\nval peerInfo: BrokerInfo = // ... get peer info\nping(peerInfo)\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of how the `SessionManager` trait might be used to create a new session with a peer:\n\n```scala\nval remote: InetSocketAddress = // ... get remote address\nval peerInfoOpt: Option[BrokerInfo] = // ... get optional peer info\nwithNewSession(remote, peerInfoOpt) { sessionId =>\n  // ... use sessionId to send a message to the peer\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `DiscoveryServerState` trait and how does it relate to the `SessionManager` trait?\n   **Answer**: The `DiscoveryServerState` trait is responsible for managing the state of the discovery server in the Alephium project, including peer management, message handling, and network communication. The `SessionManager` trait is a part of the `DiscoveryServerState` and is responsible for managing sessions and pending requests during the peer discovery process.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `DiscoveryServerState` handle adding new peers and updating their status?\n   **Answer**: The `DiscoveryServerState` handles adding new peers using the `appendPeer` method, which checks if the number of cliques from the same IP is below the maximum allowed limit before adding the peer. The status of peers is updated using the `updateStatus` method, which updates the `updateAt` timestamp of the peer in the `table` hashmap.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `DiscoveryServerState` handle banning and unbanning peers?\n   **Answer**: The `DiscoveryServerState` handles banning peers using the `banPeer` and `banPeerFromAddress` methods, which remove the peer from the `table` hashmap and mark their address as unreachable. To unban a peer, the `unsetUnreachable` method is used to remove the address from the `unreachables` cache, allowing the peer to be reachable again."
