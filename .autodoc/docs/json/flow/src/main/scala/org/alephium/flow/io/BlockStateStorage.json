  "summary": "This code defines a storage mechanism for BlockState objects in the Alephium project. The BlockStateStorage trait extends the KeyValueStorage trait and specifies that the key is a BlockHash and the value is a BlockState. The storageKey method is overridden to concatenate the bytes of the BlockHash with a ByteString that represents the postfix for the block state. \n\nThe BlockStateRockDBStorage object is a companion object that extends the RocksDBKeyValueCompanion trait and provides an apply method that creates a new instance of the BlockStateRockDBStorage class. This method takes a RocksDBSource object, a ColumnFamily object, and WriteOptions and ReadOptions objects as parameters. The BlockStateRockDBStorage class extends the RocksDBKeyValueStorage class and implements the BlockStateStorage trait. It takes the same parameters as the apply method and passes them to the superclass constructor.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to store and retrieve BlockState objects using RocksDB as the underlying storage mechanism. It can be used in the larger Alephium project to persist BlockState objects between runs of the system. For example, when a new block is added to the blockchain, its BlockState can be stored using this mechanism so that it can be retrieved later when needed. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval storage = new RocksDBSource(...)\nval cf = new ColumnFamily(...)\nval writeOptions = new WriteOptions()\nval readOptions = new ReadOptions()\n\nval blockStateStorage = BlockStateRockDBStorage(storage, cf, writeOptions, readOptions)\n\nval blockHash = BlockHash(...)\nval blockState = BlockState(...)\nblockStateStorage.put(blockHash, blockState)\n\nval retrievedBlockState = blockStateStorage.get(blockHash)\n```",
