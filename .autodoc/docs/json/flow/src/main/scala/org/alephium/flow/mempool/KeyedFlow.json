  "summary": "The `KeyedFlow` class is an indexed data structure for network flow. It is used to keep track of nodes in a network flow graph and their relationships with each other. The class takes two parameters: `sourceNodeGroups` and `allNodes`. `sourceNodeGroups` is a vector of maps that contains the source nodes of the graph, while `allNodes` is a map that contains all the nodes in the graph.\n\nThe `KeyedFlow` class provides several methods to interact with the graph. The `size` method returns the number of nodes in the graph. The `contains` method checks if a node with a given key exists in the graph. The `get` method returns an `Option` of the node with the given key. The `unsafe` method returns the node with the given key, but throws an exception if the node does not exist.\n\nThe `takeSourceNodes` method takes a source group index, a maximum number of nodes to return, and a function to apply to each node. It returns a vector of the results of applying the function to the nodes in the specified source group, up to the maximum number of nodes.\n\nThe `clear` method removes all nodes from the graph.\n\nThe `addNewNode` method adds a new node to the graph. It takes a node as a parameter and adds it to the graph, along with its relationships to other nodes. If the node has parents, it adds the node as a child to each parent. If the node has children, it adds the node as a parent to each child. If the node is a source node, it adds it to the appropriate source group.\n\nThe `removeNodeAndAncestors` method removes a node and all its ancestors from the graph. It takes a key and a side effect function as parameters. It finds the node with the given key and removes it from the graph, along with all its ancestors. It then applies the side effect function to each removed node.\n\nThe `removeNodeAndDescendants` method removes a node and all its descendants from the graph. It takes a key and a side effect function as parameters. It finds the node with the given key and removes it from the graph, along with all its descendants. It then applies the side effect function to each removed node.\n\nThe `removeSourceNode` method removes a source node from the graph. It takes a key as a parameter and removes the node with the given key from the graph, assuming it is a source node.\n\nThe `KeyedFlow` class also contains a nested trait called `Node`. This trait defines the methods and properties that a node in the graph must have. It has a type parameter `EK` for the key type and a type parameter `EN` for the node type. The `Node` trait has methods to add and remove parents and children, as well as methods to check if a node is a source or sink node.\n\nThe `KeyedFlow` object contains two utility methods: `addToBuffer` and `removeFromBuffer`. These methods are used to add and remove nodes from the parent and child buffers of a node. They take a getter function, a setter function, and a node as parameters. The getter function gets the buffer from the node, the setter function sets the buffer on the node, and the node is added or removed from the buffer as appropriate. The `remove` method is a utility method used by `removeFromBuffer` to remove a node from a buffer. It takes a buffer and a node as parameters and removes the node from the buffer.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `KeyedFlow` class?\n- The `KeyedFlow` class is an indexed data structure for network flow.\n\n2. What is the `Node` trait and what methods does it define?\n- The `Node` trait is a trait that defines methods for adding and removing parents and children to a node, as well as methods for checking if a node is a source or sink.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `addToBuffer` and `removeFromBuffer` methods?\n- The `addToBuffer` and `removeFromBuffer` methods are helper methods for adding and removing nodes from mutable arrays."
