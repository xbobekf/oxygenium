  "summary": "The `InterCliqueManager` class in this code is responsible for managing the connections and interactions between different cliques (groups of nodes) in the Alephium blockchain network. It maintains the state of connected brokers (nodes) and handles various types of messages and events related to the network.\n\nThe class provides methods to add, remove, and update the state of brokers, as well as check the number of connections per group and determine if more connections are needed. It also handles broadcasting transactions and blocks to other brokers in the network.\n\nFor example, the `handleBroadCastBlock` method is responsible for broadcasting a block to other brokers in the network. If the block originates from a local source, it sends the block to all connected brokers. If the block originates from a remote source, it sends an announcement to all connected brokers, except the one that sent the block.\n\nThe `InterCliqueManagerState` trait provides additional functionality for managing the state of brokers and connections. It includes methods for handling new connections, checking if a broker is already connected, and extracting peers to connect to based on the maximum number of outbound connections per group.\n\nOverall, the `InterCliqueManager` class and the `InterCliqueManagerState` trait play a crucial role in managing the connections and interactions between different cliques in the Alephium blockchain network, ensuring efficient communication and synchronization of data across the network.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `InterCliqueManager` class?**\n\n   The `InterCliqueManager` class is responsible for managing connections and interactions between different cliques in the Alephium network. It handles new connections, broadcasts transactions and blocks, and maintains the state of connected brokers.\n\n2. **How does the `InterCliqueManager` handle broadcasting transactions and blocks?**\n\n   The `InterCliqueManager` subscribes to events related to broadcasting transactions and blocks. When it receives a `BroadCastTx` or `BroadCastBlock` event, it iterates through the connected brokers and sends the transaction or block to the appropriate brokers based on their synced status and chain index.\n\n3. **How does the `InterCliqueManager` determine if the node is synced?**\n\n   The `InterCliqueManager` checks if the node is synced by iterating through the group range and calculating the number of relevant brokers and synced brokers for each group. The node is considered synced if the number of synced brokers is greater than or equal to half of the relevant brokers and greater than or equal to half of the bootstrap nodes."
