  "summary": "This file contains the implementation of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class, which is responsible for handling outbound connections to other brokers in the Alephium network. \n\nThe `OutboundBrokerHandler` class extends the `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler` class and implements the `BrokerHandler` trait. It takes in several parameters, including the `selfCliqueInfo`, `remoteAddress`, `blockflow`, `allHandlers`, `cliqueManager`, and `blockFlowSynchronizer`. These parameters are used to initialize the class and provide it with the necessary information to handle outbound connections.\n\nThe `OutboundBrokerHandler` class also contains a companion object with a `props` method that creates a new instance of the class with the given parameters. This method is used to create new instances of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class throughout the Alephium project.\n\nOverall, the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class is an important component of the Alephium network, as it is responsible for handling outbound connections to other brokers. By implementing the `BrokerHandler` trait and extending the `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler` class, the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class provides a standardized way of handling outbound connections that can be used throughout the Alephium project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval outboundBrokerHandler = OutboundBrokerHandler.props(\n  selfCliqueInfo,\n  remoteBroker,\n  blockflow,\n  allHandlers,\n  cliqueManager,\n  blockFlowSynchronizer\n)\nval outboundBroker = system.actorOf(outboundBrokerHandler)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   \n   This code defines a class called `OutboundBrokerHandler` that extends `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler` and `BrokerHandler`. It also defines a companion object with a `props` method that creates an instance of `OutboundBrokerHandler`. The purpose of this code is to handle outbound broker connections in the Alephium network.\n\n2. What other classes or libraries does this code depend on?\n   \n   This code depends on several other classes and libraries, including `java.net.InetSocketAddress`, `akka.actor.Props`, `org.alephium.flow.core.BlockFlow`, `org.alephium.flow.handler.AllHandlers`, `org.alephium.flow.network.CliqueManager`, `org.alephium.flow.network.broker.OutboundBrokerHandler`, `org.alephium.flow.network.sync.BlockFlowSynchronizer`, `org.alephium.flow.setting.NetworkSetting`, `org.alephium.protocol.config.BrokerConfig`, `org.alephium.protocol.model.BrokerInfo`, and `org.alephium.protocol.model.CliqueInfo`.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n   \n   This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, either version 3 of the License, or (at the developer's option) any later version."
