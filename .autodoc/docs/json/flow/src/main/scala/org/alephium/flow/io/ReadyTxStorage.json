  "summary": "This code defines a trait and a class that implement a key-value storage for transactions that are ready to be included in a block. The trait `ReadyTxStorage` defines the interface for the storage, which extends the `KeyValueStorage` trait. It provides methods to iterate over the stored transactions, clear the storage, and add or remove transactions. The `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage` class implements this interface using RocksDB as the underlying storage engine.\n\nThe `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage` class extends the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class, which provides the basic functionality for a RocksDB-backed key-value storage. The `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage` class adds the implementation of the `ReadyTxStorage` trait, which includes the `iterateE`, `iterate`, and `clear` methods. The `iterateE` method iterates over all the transactions in the storage and applies a side-effecting function to each of them, returning an `IOResult` that indicates whether the iteration was successful or not. The `iterate` method is similar, but it does not return a result. The `clear` method removes all the transactions from the storage.\n\nThe `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage` object is a companion object that provides a factory method to create instances of the `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage` class. The factory method takes a `RocksDBSource` instance, a column family, and read and write options as parameters, and returns a new instance of the `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage` class.\n\nThis code is part of the Alephium project and is used to store transactions that are ready to be included in a block. The `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage` class provides a simple and efficient way to store and retrieve these transactions using RocksDB. Other parts of the project can use this storage to keep track of the transactions that are ready to be included in a block and to remove them once they have been included. For example, the mining component of the project can use this storage to keep track of the transactions that it needs to include in the next block.",
