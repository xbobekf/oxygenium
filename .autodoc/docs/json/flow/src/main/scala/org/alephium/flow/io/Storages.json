  "summary": "The `Storages` object defines a set of storage-related utilities and data structures used in the Alephium project. The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient interface for interacting with various types of storage, including RocksDB, a high-performance key-value store. \n\nThe `Storages` object defines several constants, each of which represents a postfix used to identify different types of data stored in RocksDB. These postfixes are used to differentiate between different types of data stored in the database, such as block state, trie hash, and chain state. \n\nThe `createUnsafe` method is a factory method that creates a new instance of the `Storages` class. This method takes a root path, a storage database folder name, and a `WriteOptions` object as input parameters. It also takes an implicit `GroupConfig` object, which contains configuration information for the Alephium network. \n\nThe `createUnsafe` method creates a new instance of the `RocksDBSource` class, which is used to manage the RocksDB instance. It then creates instances of several other storage-related classes, including `BlockRockDBStorage`, `BlockHeaderRockDBStorage`, `BlockStateRockDBStorage`, `TxRocksDBStorage`, `NodeStateRockDBStorage`, `RocksDBKeyValueStorage`, `LogStorage`, `WorldStateRockDBStorage`, `PendingTxRocksDBStorage`, `ReadyTxRocksDBStorage`, and `BrokerRocksDBStorage`. These classes are used to manage different types of data stored in RocksDB, such as blocks, transactions, and contract storage. \n\nThe `Storages` class itself is a wrapper around these storage-related classes, providing a unified interface for interacting with them. It implements the `KeyValueSource` trait, which defines methods for reading and writing key-value pairs to the database. The `Storages` class also defines several other methods, including `close`, `closeUnsafe`, `dESTROY`, and `dESTROYUnsafe`, which are used to manage the lifecycle of the database. \n\nOverall, the `Storages` object provides a convenient and unified interface for interacting with the various types of storage used in the Alephium project. It abstracts away the details of interacting with RocksDB and other storage-related classes, making it easier to work with the database and manage the lifecycle of the storage system.",
