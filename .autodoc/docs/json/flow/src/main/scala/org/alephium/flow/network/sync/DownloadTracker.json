  "summary": "This code defines a trait called `DownloadTracker` that is used to track the download progress of blocks in the Alephium network. The trait extends `BaseActor`, which is a base class for actors in the Akka framework used by Alephium. \n\nThe `DownloadTracker` trait defines several methods and a mutable HashMap called `syncing`. The `syncing` HashMap is used to keep track of blocks that are currently being synced. The keys of the HashMap are `BlockHash` objects, which represent the hash of a block in the Alephium blockchain. The values of the HashMap are `TimeStamp` objects, which represent the time when the block was added to the HashMap.\n\nThe `needToDownload` method takes a `BlockHash` object as input and returns a Boolean indicating whether the block needs to be downloaded. The method returns `true` if the block is not in the `syncing` HashMap and is not already in the `BlockFlow` object, which represents the local copy of the blockchain.\n\nThe `download` method takes a vector of vectors of `BlockHash` objects as input and downloads the blocks that need to be downloaded. The method first flattens the input vector and filters out the blocks that do not need to be downloaded using the `needToDownload` method. It then adds the remaining blocks to the `syncing` HashMap with the current timestamp and sends a message to the `BrokerHandler` actor to download the blocks.\n\nThe `finalized` method takes a `BlockHash` object as input and removes it from the `syncing` HashMap. This method is called when a block has been successfully downloaded and added to the local copy of the blockchain.\n\nThe `cleanupSyncing` method removes blocks from the `syncing` HashMap that have been syncing for longer than a specified duration. The method takes a `Duration` object as input and removes all blocks from the `syncing` HashMap that have a timestamp older than the current time minus the input duration. The method also logs the number of blocks that were removed from the HashMap.\n\nOverall, the `DownloadTracker` trait is used to manage the download progress of blocks in the Alephium network. It provides methods to check whether a block needs to be downloaded, download blocks, and clean up the `syncing` HashMap. The trait is likely used by other actors in the Alephium network to coordinate block downloads and ensure that all nodes have an up-to-date copy of the blockchain.",
