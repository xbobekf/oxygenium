  "summary": "The `GasEstimation` object is responsible for estimating the amount of gas required to execute various types of scripts in the Alephium blockchain. Gas is a measure of computational effort required to execute a script, and is used to prevent spamming and denial-of-service attacks on the network. \n\nThe `GasEstimation` object provides several methods for estimating gas based on different types of scripts. The `sweepAddress` method estimates gas required for unlocking a P2PKH address. The `estimateWithP2PKHInputs` method estimates gas required for unlocking multiple P2PKH inputs. The `estimateWithInputScript` method estimates gas required for unlocking inputs with a given script. The `estimate` method estimates gas required for executing a transaction with a given set of inputs and outputs. Finally, the `estimate` method estimates gas required for executing a stateful script.\n\nThe `GasEstimation` object uses several other objects and classes to estimate gas. The `GasSchedule` object provides constants for the base gas required for various types of scripts. The `AssetScriptGasEstimator` and `TxScriptGasEstimator` classes estimate gas required for executing asset and transaction scripts, respectively. The `UnlockScript` and `StatefulScript` classes represent different types of scripts that can be executed on the Alephium blockchain.\n\nOverall, the `GasEstimation` object is an important component of the Alephium blockchain that helps ensure the security and reliability of the network. Developers can use the methods provided by this object to estimate the amount of gas required for executing different types of scripts, which can help them optimize their code and avoid running out of gas during execution.",
