  "summary": "This code defines the `CliqueManager` class, which is responsible for managing the communication between different cliques in the Alephium network. A clique is a group of nodes that are connected to each other and share the same blockchain. The `CliqueManager` class is an Akka actor that coordinates the creation of intra-clique and inter-clique managers.\n\nThe `CliqueManager` class has four constructor parameters: `blockflow`, `allHandlers`, `discoveryServer`, `blockFlowSynchronizer`, and `numBootstrapNodes`. These parameters are used to create the intra-clique and inter-clique managers.\n\nThe `CliqueManager` class has three message types: `Start`, `Synced`, and `IsSelfCliqueReady`. The `Start` message is sent to the `CliqueManager` to start the intra-clique and inter-clique managers. The `Synced` message is sent to the `CliqueManager` when a broker is synced with the network. The `IsSelfCliqueReady` message is sent to the `CliqueManager` to check if the self-clique is ready.\n\nThe `CliqueManager` class has three states: `awaitStart`, `awaitIntraCliqueReady`, and `isSelfCliqueSynced`. In the `awaitStart` state, the `CliqueManager` waits for a `Start` message to create the intra-clique and inter-clique managers. In the `awaitIntraCliqueReady` state, the `CliqueManager` waits for the intra-clique manager to be ready before creating the inter-clique manager. In the `isSelfCliqueSynced` state, the `CliqueManager` responds to `IsSelfCliqueReady` messages with the status of the self-clique.\n\nThe `CliqueManager` class is used in the Alephium network to manage the communication between different cliques. It coordinates the creation of intra-clique and inter-clique managers, which are responsible for managing the communication within and between cliques. The `CliqueManager` class is an important component of the Alephium network, as it ensures that the different cliques are able to communicate with each other and share the same blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CliqueManager` class and what does it do?\n- The `CliqueManager` class is responsible for managing the intra and inter clique managers, and ensuring that the self-clique is synced. It receives messages such as `Start`, `Synced`, and `IsSelfCliqueReady` to perform its tasks.\n\n2. What other classes or libraries does this code import and use?\n- The code imports several classes and libraries such as `akka.actor`, `akka.io.Tcp`, `org.alephium.flow.core.BlockFlow`, `org.alephium.flow.handler.AllHandlers`, `org.alephium.flow.network.sync.BlockFlowSynchronizer`, `org.alephium.flow.setting.NetworkSetting`, `org.alephium.protocol.config.BrokerConfig`, and `org.alephium.protocol.model`.\n\n3. What is the license for this code and where can it be found?\n- The code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the license can be found in the comments at the beginning of the file, as well as at the specified URL."
