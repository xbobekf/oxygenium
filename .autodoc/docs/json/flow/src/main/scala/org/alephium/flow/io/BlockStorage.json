  "summary": "This code defines a `BlockStorage` trait and a `BlockRockDBStorage` class that implements it. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to store and retrieve `Block` objects using RocksDB, a high-performance key-value store. \n\nThe `BlockStorage` trait extends the `KeyValueStorage` trait, which defines methods for storing and retrieving key-value pairs. The `BlockStorage` trait adds two methods for storing `Block` objects: `put` and `putUnsafe`. The `put` method takes a `Block` object and stores it in the key-value store using the block's hash as the key. The `putUnsafe` method does the same thing, but does not return an `IOResult` object, which is used to indicate whether the operation was successful or not. \n\nThe `BlockRockDBStorage` class extends the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class, which provides an implementation of the `KeyValueStorage` trait using RocksDB. The `BlockRockDBStorage` class adds the `BlockStorage` trait to this implementation, allowing it to store and retrieve `Block` objects. \n\nThe `BlockRockDBStorage` class has a companion object that provides a factory method for creating instances of the class. This method takes a `RocksDBSource` object, a `ColumnFamily` object, and `WriteOptions` and `ReadOptions` objects, and returns a new `BlockRockDBStorage` object. \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to store and retrieve `Block` objects using RocksDB. This is likely used in the larger Alephium project to store and retrieve blocks in the blockchain. Here is an example of how this code might be used:\n\n```\nval storage = RocksDBSource.open(...)\nval cf = storage.createColumnFamily(\"blocks\")\nval writeOptions = new WriteOptions()\nval readOptions = new ReadOptions()\n\nval blockStorage = BlockRockDBStorage(storage, cf, writeOptions, readOptions)\n\nval block = Block(...)\nblockStorage.put(block)\n\nval retrievedBlock = blockStorage.get(block.hash)\n```",
