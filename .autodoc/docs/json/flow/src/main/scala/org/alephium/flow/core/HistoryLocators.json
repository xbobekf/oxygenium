  "summary": "The `HistoryLocators` object in the `core` package of the `alephium` project provides a method for sampling block heights within a given range. The `sampleHeights` method takes two integer arguments, `fromHeight` and `toHeight`, which represent the inclusive range of block heights to sample. The method returns an `AVector` of integers representing the sampled block heights.\n\nThe sampling algorithm works by starting at the `toHeight` block and iteratively subtracting a power of 2 from the height until the `fromHeight` block is reached. At each step, the current height is added to a mutable `ArrayBuffer` of heights. The resulting array is then converted to an `AVector` and reversed to produce the final output.\n\nThis method may be used in the larger project to efficiently sample block heights for various purposes, such as determining the difficulty of mining a block or verifying the validity of a transaction. For example, if a transaction references a block height within a certain range, the `sampleHeights` method could be used to ensure that the referenced block is valid and part of the blockchain. \n\nHere is an example usage of the `sampleHeights` method:\n\n```\nval fromHeight = 100\nval toHeight = 200\nval sampledHeights = HistoryLocators.sampleHeights(fromHeight, toHeight)\nprintln(sampledHeights) // prints AVector(100, 125, 150, 175, 200)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Scala object called `HistoryLocators` that contains a function `sampleHeights` which returns a vector of heights based on the input parameters `fromHeight` and `toHeight`.\n\n2. What is the input and output of the `sampleHeights` function?\n- The `sampleHeights` function takes in two integers `fromHeight` and `toHeight` and returns a vector of integers representing heights.\n- The `fromHeight` and `toHeight` parameters are inclusive, meaning that the returned vector includes both the `fromHeight` and `toHeight` values.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n- This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
