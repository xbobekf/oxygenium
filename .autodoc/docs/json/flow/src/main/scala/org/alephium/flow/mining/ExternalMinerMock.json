  "summary": "This code defines a mock external miner for the Alephium project. The miner is responsible for mining new blocks and submitting them to the network. The miner connects to the Alephium network via a TCP connection to the miner API. The miner receives mining tasks from the network and submits the resulting blocks back to the network.\n\nThe `ExternalMinerMock` object defines several methods for creating instances of the miner. The `singleNode` method creates a miner instance for a single node. The `props` method creates a miner instance for multiple nodes. The `connection` method creates a TCP connection to a remote node.\n\nThe `ExternalMinerMock` class extends the `Miner` trait, which defines the basic functionality of a miner. The `ExternalMinerMock` class overrides the `receive` method to handle mining tasks and TCP connections. The `subscribeForTasks` method subscribes the miner to receive mining tasks from the network. The `unsubscribeTasks` method unsubscribes the miner from receiving mining tasks. The `publishNewBlock` method publishes a new block to the network.\n\nThe `handleMiningTasks` method handles incoming mining tasks from the network. The `handleServerMessage` method handles incoming messages from the miner API. The `updateAndStartTasks` method updates the miner's pending tasks and starts new tasks. The `reconnectTo` method attempts to reconnect to a remote node if the connection is lost. The `shutdown` method shuts down the system if the miner cannot connect to a remote node.\n\nOverall, this code defines a mock external miner that can connect to the Alephium network and mine new blocks. The miner receives mining tasks from the network and submits the resulting blocks back to the network. The miner can connect to multiple nodes and attempt to reconnect if the connection is lost.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an external miner mock for the Alephium project, which is responsible for connecting to the miner API and handling mining tasks.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on Akka, a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems, and on the GNU Lesser General Public License, a free software license.\n\n3. What is the role of the `backoffStrategies` variable?\n- The `backoffStrategies` variable is a mutable HashMap that stores the backoff strategies for each remote address. It is used to retry connecting to a remote address with an exponential backoff strategy in case of connection failure."
