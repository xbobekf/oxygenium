  "summary": "This code defines a storage mechanism for brokers in the Alephium network. The `BrokerStorage` trait defines the interface for this storage mechanism, which extends the `KeyValueStorage` trait. The `BrokerRocksDBStorage` class implements this interface and provides a concrete implementation of the storage mechanism using RocksDB as the underlying key-value store.\n\nThe `BrokerStorage` trait defines two methods: `addBroker` and `activeBrokers`. The `addBroker` method takes a `BrokerInfo` object and adds it to the storage. The `activeBrokers` method returns a list of all active brokers in the network.\n\nThe `BrokerRocksDBStorage` class extends the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class, which provides a generic implementation of the key-value storage mechanism using RocksDB. The `BrokerRocksDBStorage` class overrides the `addBroker` and `activeBrokers` methods to provide the specific implementation for the broker storage.\n\nThe `addBroker` method takes a `BrokerInfo` object, creates a `BrokerDiscoveryState` object from it, and stores it in the key-value store using the `put` method.\n\nThe `activeBrokers` method iterates over all the key-value pairs in the store and creates a `BrokerInfo` object for each active broker. It then returns a list of all the `BrokerInfo` objects.\n\nThis code is used in the Alephium network to store information about brokers. The `BrokerStorage` trait provides a generic interface for storing and retrieving broker information, while the `BrokerRocksDBStorage` class provides a specific implementation using RocksDB as the underlying key-value store. This code can be used by other components of the Alephium network to store and retrieve broker information. For example, the `addBroker` method can be used by the broker discovery mechanism to add new brokers to the network, while the `activeBrokers` method can be used by other components to get a list of all active brokers in the network.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a `BrokerStorage` trait and a `BrokerRocksDBStorage` class that implements it. It provides methods to add a broker and retrieve active brokers from a RocksDB database.\n\n2. What other dependencies does this code have?\n   - This code imports several classes from other packages, including `org.rocksdb`, `org.alephium.flow.model`, `org.alephium.io`, and `org.alephium.protocol.model`. It also extends a `KeyValueStorage` trait and a `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
