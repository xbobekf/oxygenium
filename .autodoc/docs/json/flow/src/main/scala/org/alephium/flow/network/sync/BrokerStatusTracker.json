  "summary": "This file contains code related to tracking the status of brokers in the Alephium network. The purpose of this code is to keep track of the brokers that are connected to the network and their status. The code defines two case classes, `ConnectingBroker` and `HandShakedBroker`, which represent brokers that are in the process of connecting and brokers that have completed the handshake process, respectively. \n\nThe `BrokerStatusTracker` trait defines methods for tracking the status of brokers. The `brokerInfos` variable is an `ArrayBuffer` that stores the `ActorRefT[BrokerHandler.Command]` and `BrokerInfo` of each broker that is connected to the network. The `samplePeersSize` method calculates the number of peers to sample for synchronization based on the square root of the number of brokers connected to the network. The `samplePeers` method returns a vector of sampled peers based on the `samplePeersSize` method.\n\nThe `BrokerStatusTracker` trait is used in other parts of the Alephium project to manage the synchronization of data between brokers. For example, the `BrokerSync` class uses the `BrokerStatusTracker` trait to manage the synchronization of blocks between brokers. \n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the Alephium network as it helps to ensure that brokers are connected and synchronized with each other. By tracking the status of brokers, the network can maintain consistency and reliability.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a trait and an object related to tracking the status of brokers in a network sync for the Alephium project.\n\n2. What is the license for this code?\n   - This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.\n\n3. What data structures are used to track connecting and handshaked brokers?\n   - The code uses a mutable HashMap to track connecting brokers and a mutable HashSet to track handshaked brokers."
