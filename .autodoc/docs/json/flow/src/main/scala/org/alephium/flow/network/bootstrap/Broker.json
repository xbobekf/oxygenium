  "summary": "The `Broker` class is a part of the `alephium` project and is responsible for connecting to the master node and receiving the clique information. The clique information is then sent to the `Bootstrapper` actor. \n\nThe `Broker` class is an Akka actor that communicates with the master node using the TCP protocol. It sends a `Tcp.Connect` message to the master node to establish a connection. If the connection is successful, it sends a `Message.Peer` message to the master node containing information about itself. The `Message.Peer` message is serialized using the `Message.serialize` method and sent to the master node using the `ConnectionHandler.Send` method. \n\nIf the connection is unsuccessful, the `Broker` actor schedules a retry after a certain amount of time. If the retry limit is exceeded, the system is terminated. \n\nOnce the `Broker` actor receives the clique information from the master node, it sends an acknowledgement message to the master node using the `Message.Ack` message. If the master node receives the acknowledgement message, it sends a `Message.Ready` message to the `Broker` actor indicating that the clique is ready. \n\nUpon receiving the `Message.Ready` message, the `Broker` actor sends the clique information to the `Bootstrapper` actor using the `Bootstrapper.SendIntraCliqueInfo` message and terminates itself. \n\nThe `Broker` class also defines the `MyConnectionHandler` class, which is responsible for handling the incoming messages from the master node. The `MyConnectionHandler` class deserializes the incoming messages using the `Message.tryDeserialize` method and handles the messages based on their type. If the incoming message is invalid, the `MyConnectionHandler` class stops itself. \n\nOverall, the `Broker` class is an important component of the `alephium` project that establishes a connection with the master node and receives the clique information. The clique information is then sent to the `Bootstrapper` actor, which uses it to bootstrap the network. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval bootstrapper: ActorRefT[Bootstrapper.Command] = ???\nimplicit val brokerConfig: BrokerConfig = ???\nimplicit val networkSetting: NetworkSetting = ???\n\nval broker = system.actorOf(Broker.props(bootstrapper))\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code is part of the alephium project and it implements a broker that connects to a master node to receive clique information during the bootstrap phase of the network.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n   \n   This code depends on Akka, a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems, and on the Alephium project, which provides the setting and configuration for the network.\n\n3. What is the license for this code?\n   \n   This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
