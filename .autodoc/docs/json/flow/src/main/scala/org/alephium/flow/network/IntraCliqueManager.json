  "summary": "The `IntraCliqueManager` class is part of the Alephium project and is responsible for managing the intra-clique communication between brokers in a clique. A clique is a group of brokers that work together to maintain the blockchain network. The purpose of this class is to ensure that all brokers in a clique are connected and synced with each other.\n\nThe class is implemented as an Akka actor and receives messages from other actors in the system. When the actor is started, it connects to other brokers in the clique and waits for them to connect back. Once all brokers are connected, the actor subscribes to events related to broadcasting blocks and transactions. When a block or transaction is broadcasted, the actor sends it to all other brokers in the clique, except for the one that originated the message.\n\nThe `IntraCliqueManager` class is used in the larger Alephium project to ensure that all brokers in a clique are synced with each other. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the blockchain network and ensuring that all transactions are processed correctly. By managing the intra-clique communication, the class helps to prevent forks in the blockchain and other issues that can arise when brokers are not synced with each other.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval cliqueInfo: CliqueInfo = ???\nval blockflow: BlockFlow = ???\nval allHandlers: AllHandlers = ???\nval cliqueManager: ActorRefT[CliqueManager.Command] = ???\nval blockFlowSynchronizer: ActorRefT[BlockFlowSynchronizer.Command] = ???\nimplicit val brokerConfig: BrokerConfig = ???\nimplicit val networkSetting: NetworkSetting = ???\n\nval intraCliqueManager = system.actorOf(IntraCliqueManager.props(\n  cliqueInfo,\n  blockflow,\n  allHandlers,\n  cliqueManager,\n  blockFlowSynchronizer\n))\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains the implementation of the IntraCliqueManager actor, which manages the communication between brokers within a clique in the Alephium network.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code file?\n- This code file depends on several other classes and packages, including Akka actors, ByteString, and various classes from the Alephium protocol and flow packages.\n\n3. What is the role of the IntraCliqueManager actor in the Alephium network?\n- The IntraCliqueManager actor is responsible for managing communication between brokers within a clique in the Alephium network, including syncing blocks and transactions between brokers."
