  "summary": "This file contains code related to cryptographic hashing using the SHA-256 algorithm. The code is part of the Alephium project and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe `org.alephium.crypto` package contains a class called `Sha256` which takes a `ByteString` as input and extends the `RandomBytes` trait. The `RandomBytes` trait is used to generate random bytes for cryptographic purposes. The `Sha256` class is used to hash the input `ByteString` using the SHA-256 algorithm.\n\nThe `Sha256` class is accompanied by an object called `Sha256` which extends the `BCHashSchema` trait. The `BCHashSchema` trait is used to define a schema for hashing functions that are compatible with the Bitcoin protocol. The `Sha256` object defines a `length` method which returns the length of the hash in bytes (32 bytes for SHA-256). It also defines a `provider` method which returns a new instance of the `SHA256Digest` class from the Bouncy Castle library. The `SHA256Digest` class is used to perform the actual hashing of the input data.\n\nThe `Sha256` object also defines a `apply` method which takes a `ByteString` as input and returns a new instance of the `Sha256` class with the hashed `ByteString` as its input. This method can be used to easily hash data using the SHA-256 algorithm.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to perform SHA-256 hashing in the Alephium project. It can be used for various cryptographic purposes such as generating secure hashes of data for verification and authentication.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Sha256` class and how is it used?\n   - The `Sha256` class is used to represent a SHA-256 hash value as a `ByteString`. It extends the `RandomBytes` trait and can be used to generate random bytes. \n\n2. What is the `Sha256` object and what does it do?\n   - The `Sha256` object provides a `BCHashSchema` implementation for the `Sha256` class, which allows it to be used as a hash function in the Alephium project. It also provides a `length` method that returns the length of the hash in bytes and a `provider` method that returns a new instance of the `SHA256Digest` class from the Bouncy Castle library.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
