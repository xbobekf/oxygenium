  "summary": "The `WalletGen` object is a tool for generating wallets for the Alephium cryptocurrency. It is used to generate a set of public and private keys, along with their corresponding addresses and mnemonics. \n\nThe `gen` method is the core of the tool. It takes a `GroupIndex` as input and returns a tuple containing an `Address`, a `SecP256K1PublicKey`, a `SecP256K1PrivateKey`, and a `Mnemonic`. The `GroupIndex` is used to ensure that the generated address belongs to the specified group. The method generates a random 24-word mnemonic, which is used to derive a BIP32 master key. From this master key, a private key, public key, and address are derived. If the generated address does not belong to the specified group, the method is called recursively until a valid address is generated.\n\nThe `WalletGen` object also contains a `main` method that generates wallets for two different network IDs. The `foreach` loop iterates over each network ID and generates wallets for a specified number of groups. The `printLine` method is used to print the results to the console.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `WalletGen` tool:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.tools.WalletGen\nimport org.alephium.protocol.config.GroupConfig\nimport org.alephium.protocol.model.GroupIndex\nimport org.alephium.protocol.model.NetworkId\n\nimplicit val config: GroupConfig = new GroupConfig {\n  override def groups: Int = 4\n}\n\nval (address, pubKey, priKey, mnemonic) = WalletGen.gen(GroupIndex.unsafe(0))\n\nprintln(s\"Address: ${address.toBase58}\")\nprintln(s\"Public Key: ${pubKey.toHexString}\")\nprintln(s\"Private Key: ${priKey.toHexString}\")\nprintln(s\"Mnemonic: ${mnemonic.toLongString}\")\n```\n\nThis code generates a wallet for the first group of the default network ID (1). The `GroupConfig` object specifies that there are 4 groups in the network. The `gen` method is called with a `GroupIndex` of 0 to generate a wallet for the first group. The resulting address, public key, private key, and mnemonic are printed to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code generates wallet addresses, public and private keys, and mnemonics for the Alephium cryptocurrency project.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n   \n   This code imports several libraries from the Alephium project, including `org.alephium.crypto`, `org.alephium.crypto.wallet`, `org.alephium.protocol`, and `org.alephium.wallet.Constants`.\n\n3. What is the output of this code?\n   \n   This code outputs wallet information for two different network IDs, including the group number, address, public key, private key, and mnemonic for each group."
