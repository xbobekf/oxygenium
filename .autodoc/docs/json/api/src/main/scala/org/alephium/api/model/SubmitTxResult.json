  "summary": "This file contains a Scala case class called `SubmitTxResult` that is used in the Alephium project. The purpose of this class is to represent the result of submitting a transaction to the Alephium network. \n\nThe `SubmitTxResult` class has three fields: `txId`, `fromGroup`, and `toGroup`. `txId` is of type `TransactionId`, which is defined in another file in the project and represents the unique identifier of a transaction. `fromGroup` and `toGroup` are both of type `Int` and represent the source and destination groups of the transaction, respectively. \n\nThis class is likely used in other parts of the Alephium project where transactions are submitted and their results need to be represented. For example, it could be used in an API endpoint that allows users to submit transactions and returns the result of the submission. \n\nHere is an example of how this class could be used in Scala code:\n\n```\nimport org.alephium.api.model.SubmitTxResult\nimport org.alephium.protocol.model.TransactionId\n\nval txId = TransactionId(\"abc123\")\nval fromGroup = 1\nval toGroup = 2\n\nval result = SubmitTxResult(txId, fromGroup, toGroup)\n\nprintln(result.txId) // prints \"abc123\"\nprintln(result.fromGroup) // prints 1\nprintln(result.toGroup) // prints 2\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new `SubmitTxResult` object with a `TransactionId` of \"abc123\", a `fromGroup` of 1, and a `toGroup` of 2. We then print out each field of the object using the `println` function.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SubmitTxResult` case class?\n   - The `SubmitTxResult` case class is used to represent the result of submitting a transaction, including the transaction ID and the source and destination groups.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `TransactionId` import statement?\n   - The `TransactionId` import statement indicates that the `TransactionId` type is used in the `SubmitTxResult` case class.\n\n3. What is the `alephium` project licensed under?\n   - The `alephium` project is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, as stated in the code comments."
