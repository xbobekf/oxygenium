  "summary": "The `UtilJson` object provides various implicit conversions and definitions for JSON serialization and deserialization of certain types used in the Alephium project. \n\nThe object defines implicit conversions for serializing and deserializing `AVector`, a custom vector implementation used in the project. It also provides an implicit conversion for serializing and deserializing `BigInteger` objects to and from JSON. Additionally, it defines conversions for serializing and deserializing `ByteString` objects, which are used to represent binary data as hexadecimal strings. \n\nThe object also provides conversions for serializing and deserializing `InetAddress` and `InetSocketAddress` objects, which are used to represent network addresses. Finally, it defines conversions for serializing and deserializing `TimeStamp` objects, which represent a point in time.\n\nThese conversions are used throughout the Alephium project to convert various types to and from JSON format. For example, the `InetSocketAddress` conversion is used to serialize and deserialize network addresses when communicating with other nodes in the Alephium network. \n\nOverall, the `UtilJson` object provides a set of useful conversions for JSON serialization and deserialization of various types used in the Alephium project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains utility functions for JSON serialization and deserialization for the Alephium project's API.\n\n2. What external libraries does this code file depend on?\n- This code file depends on the upickle and akka libraries for JSON serialization and deserialization.\n\n3. What types of data can be serialized and deserialized using this code file?\n- This code file provides implicit conversions for serializing and deserializing AVector, BigInteger, ByteString, InetAddress, InetSocketAddress, and TimeStamp data types."
