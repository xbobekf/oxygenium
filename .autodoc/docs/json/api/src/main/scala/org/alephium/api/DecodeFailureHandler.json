  "summary": "This file contains code related to handling decode failures in the Alephium API. The `DecodeFailureHandler` trait defines a custom failure handler for decoding errors that may occur when processing API requests. \n\nThe `failureResponse` method takes in a `StatusCode`, a list of `Header`s, and a message string, and returns a `ValuedEndpointOutput` object. This object contains information about the response that should be sent back to the client in the event of a decoding failure. The response includes a status code, headers, and a JSON body containing an error message. \n\nThe `failureMessage` method takes in a `DecodeFailureContext` object and returns a string message describing the failure. This message includes information about the source of the failure (e.g. which input parameter caused the failure) and any additional details about the failure (e.g. validation errors or error messages). \n\nFinally, the `myDecodeFailureHandler` value is defined as a copy of the default decode failure handler, with the `response`, `respond`, and `failureMessage` methods overridden to use the custom failure handling logic defined in this trait. \n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the Alephium API, as it ensures that clients receive informative error messages when decoding failures occur during API requests. This can help developers more easily diagnose and fix issues with their API integrations. \n\nExample usage of this code might look like:\n\n```scala\nval myEndpoint = endpoint.get\n  .in(\"my\" / \"endpoint\")\n  .in(query[String](\"param\"))\n  .out(stringBody)\n  .errorOut(\n    oneOf[ApiError](\n      statusMapping(StatusCode.BadRequest, jsonBody[ApiError.BadRequest])\n    )\n  )\n\nval myLogic: String => IO[String] = { param =>\n  // process request logic here\n}\n\nval myServer = myEndpoint.toRoutes(myLogic).map(_.intercept(myDecodeFailureHandler))\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines a trait `DecodeFailureHandler` that provides a custom implementation of the `failureResponse` and `failureMessage` methods for handling decoding failures in an API. It also defines a `myDecodeFailureHandler` object that uses this custom implementation.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?\n    \n    This code relies on the `sttp` and `tapir` libraries for defining and handling API endpoints, as well as the `org.alephium.api` package for defining custom error responses.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n    \n    This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, either version 3 of the License, or (at the user's option) any later version."
