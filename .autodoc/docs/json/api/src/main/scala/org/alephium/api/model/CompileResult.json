  "summary": "This file contains code related to compiling Alephium smart contracts and scripts. The code defines several case classes that represent the results of compiling a script or contract, as well as a case class that represents the result of compiling an entire project. \n\nThe `CompileScriptResult` case class represents the result of compiling a script. It contains information such as the version of the script, the script's name, the bytecode template, the bytecode debug patch, the script's fields, functions, and warnings. The `CompileContractResult` case class represents the result of compiling a contract. It contains similar information to `CompileScriptResult`, but also includes the contract's code hash and debug code hash, as well as information about the contract's events and standard interface ID. \n\nThe `CompileProjectResult` case class represents the result of compiling an entire project. It contains vectors of `CompileContractResult` and `CompileScriptResult` objects. \n\nThe `CompileProjectResult` object also defines several helper methods. The `diffPatch` method takes two strings representing bytecode and returns a `Patch` object that represents the difference between the two bytecodes. The `applyPatchUnsafe` method takes a string of bytecode and a `Patch` object and applies the patch to the bytecode. \n\nThe `CompileResult` object defines several case classes that represent the signatures of a contract's or script's fields, functions, and events. These case classes are used in the `CompileScriptResult` and `CompileContractResult` case classes. \n\nOverall, this file provides functionality for compiling Alephium smart contracts and scripts, and represents the results of that compilation. It also provides helper methods for working with bytecode patches.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CompileProjectResult` class?\n- `CompileProjectResult` is a case class that holds the results of compiling a project, including a vector of `CompileContractResult` and a vector of `CompileScriptResult`.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `CompileContractResult` class?\n- `CompileContractResult` is a case class that holds the results of compiling a contract, including its bytecode, code hash, fields signature, functions signature, events signature, and warnings.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CompileScriptResult` class?\n- `CompileScriptResult` is a case class that holds the results of compiling a script, including its bytecode template, fields signature, functions signature, and warnings."
