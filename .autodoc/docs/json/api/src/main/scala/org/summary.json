              "summary": "This file contains code for handling API errors in the Alephium project. The code defines a sealed trait called `ApiError` that represents an error that can occur in the API. The trait has a single method `detail` that returns a string describing the error. The file also defines several case classes that extend the `ApiError` trait and represent specific types of errors that can occur in the API. These case classes include `Unauthorized`, `BadRequest`, `ServiceUnavailable`, `InternalServerError`, and `NotFound`.\n\nEach case class has a `detail` field that provides a string description of the error. The `NotFound` case class also has a `resource` field that specifies the resource that was not found. The case classes also define a companion object that extends the `Companion` trait. The companion object provides methods for creating and reading instances of the case class, as well as defining a schema for the error.\n\nThe file also imports several classes from the `sttp` and `tapir` libraries that are used to define the schema for the errors. The `Schema` class is used to define the schema for the errors, and the `SProduct` and `SProductField` classes are used to define the fields of the schema.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to handle errors that can occur in the Alephium API. The `ApiError` trait provides a common interface for all errors, while the case classes provide specific implementations for different types of errors. The companion objects provide methods for creating and reading instances of the case classes, and the schema definitions provide a way to serialize and deserialize the errors. This code is an important part of the Alephium project, as it ensures that errors are handled consistently and effectively throughout the API. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval error = ApiError.NotFound(\"Resource not found\")\nprintln(error.detail) // prints \"Resource not found\"\n```",

These instances are used to convert the data models to and from JSON format. Some of the data models include `PeerStatus`, `HashRateResponse`, `CurrentDifficulty`, `Transaction`, `BlockEntry`, `NodeInfo`, `ChainParams`, `Balance`, `UTXO`, `BuildTransaction`, `SubmitTransaction`, `CompileScript`, `TestContract`, `CallContract`, and many more.\n\nFor example, the `transactionRW` instance is used to convert a `Transaction` object to and from JSON format. This is useful when sending or receiving transaction data through the API.\n\n```scala\nimplicit val transactionRW: RW[Transaction] = macroRW\n```\n\nThe code also provides utility functions for converting between internal data structures and their string representations, such as `byteStringWriter`, `byteStringReader`, `bytesWriter`, and `bytesReader`.\n\nIn summary, this code file is essential for the Alephium project as it provides a way to interact with the Alephium blockchain through a well-defined API, allowing developers to build applications on top of the Alephium blockchain.",

For example, `u256Writer` and `u256Reader` are defined for `U256`, and `i256Writer` and `i256Reader` are defined for `I256`. These instances handle the conversion between the custom data types and their corresponding JSON or string representations.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the code handle errors during the conversion process?\n   **Answer**: The code uses the `Abort` class from the `upickle.core` package to handle errors during the conversion process. When an error occurs, such as an invalid input or a failed conversion, an `Abort` instance is thrown with a descriptive error message. This helps developers identify and fix issues related to data conversion."

The trait defines several types and methods that can be used to create endpoints with or without an API key. \n\nThe `BaseEndpoint` trait extends several other traits and imports several libraries, including `sttp`, `Tapir`, and `ScalaLogging`. The `sttp` library is used to define HTTP endpoints, while `Tapir` is used to define the structure of the request and response bodies. `ScalaLogging` is used for logging.\n\nThe `BaseEndpoint` trait defines two types of endpoints: `BaseEndpointWithoutApi` and `BaseEndpoint`. The former is an endpoint that does not require an API key, while the latter is an endpoint that requires an API key. The `BaseEndpoint` type is a `PartialServerEndpoint` that takes an optional `ApiKey` and an input and output type. The `ApiKey` is used to authenticate requests to the endpoint. \n\nThe `BaseEndpoint` trait also defines a `serverLogic` method that takes an endpoint and a logic function. The logic function takes an input and returns a `Future` that resolves to either an error or an output. The `serverLogic` method returns a `ServerEndpoint` that can be used to handle requests to the endpoint.\n\nThe `BaseEndpoint` trait is used as a base for other endpoint traits in the Alephium project. These traits define specific endpoints for different parts of the project, such as the wallet or the mining pool. By using the `BaseEndpoint` trait, these endpoint traits can share common functionality and ensure consistency across the project.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\ntrait MyEndpoint extends BaseEndpoint {\n  case class MyInput(param1: String, param2: Int)\n  case class MyOutput(result: String)\n\n  val myEndpoint: BaseEndpoint[MyInput, MyOutput] = baseEndpoint.in(\"my-endpoint\").in(jsonBody[MyInput]).out(jsonBody[MyOutput])\n\n  def myLogic(input: MyInput): Future[Either[ApiError[_ <: StatusCode], MyOutput]] = {\n    // do some logic\n    Future.successful(Right(MyOutput(\"result\")))\n  }\n\n  val myServerEndpoint: ServerEndpoint[Option[ApiKey], Unit, MyInput, ApiError[_ <: StatusCode], MyOutput, Any, Future] = serverLogic(myEndpoint)(myLogic)\n}\n```",

This object contains information about the response that should be sent back to the client in the event of a decoding failure. The response includes a status code, headers, and a JSON body containing an error message. \n\nThe `failureMessage` method takes in a `DecodeFailureContext` object and returns a string message describing the failure. This message includes information about the source of the failure (e.g. which input parameter caused the failure) and any additional details about the failure (e.g. validation errors or error messages). \n\nFinally, the `myDecodeFailureHandler` value is defined as a copy of the default decode failure handler, with the `response`, `respond`, and `failureMessage` methods overridden to use the custom failure handling logic defined in this trait. \n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the Alephium API, as it ensures that clients receive informative error messages when decoding failures occur during API requests.

These categories cover various functionalities of the Alephium blockchain, such as node information, address management, multi-signature transactions, contract management, and event handling.\n\nFor example, the `getNodeInfo` endpoint retrieves information about a node, while the `getBalance` endpoint fetches the balance of an address. The `buildTransaction` and `submitTransaction` endpoints are used to create and submit transactions, respectively. The `compileContract` and `buildDeployContractTx` endpoints allow users to compile and deploy smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\nThe code also defines input validation and query parameters for the endpoints, such as `timeIntervalQuery`, `counterQuery`, and `chainIndexQuery`. These parameters are used to filter or customize the API responses.\n\nHere's an example of an endpoint definition:\n\n```scala\nval getBalance: BaseEndpoint[Address, Balance] =\n  addressesEndpoint.get\n    .in(path[Address](\"address\"))\n    .in(\"balance\")\n    .out(jsonBodyWithAlph[Balance])\n    .summary(\"Get the balance of an address\")\n```\n\nThis endpoint is a part of the `addresses` category and is used to get the balance of an address.

              "summary": "This code defines a set of Tapir schemas for various types used in the Alephium project. Tapir is a library for building HTTP APIs in Scala, and these schemas define the expected input and output types for the API endpoints.\n\nThe schemas cover a wide range of types, including addresses, hashes, public keys, signatures, timestamps, and more. For each type, a Tapir schema is defined that specifies the expected format of the data. For example, the `addressSchema` specifies that an address should be represented as a string in the format \"address\", while the `hashSchema` specifies that a hash should be represented as a string in the format \"32-byte-hash\".\n\nThese schemas are used throughout the Alephium project to ensure that data is properly formatted when passed between different components. For example, when an API endpoint receives an address as input, it can use the `addressSchema` to validate that the input is in the correct format. Similarly, when an API endpoint returns a hash as output, it can use the `hashSchema` to ensure that the hash is properly formatted before sending it back to the client.\n\nOverall, these Tapir schemas play an important role in ensuring that the Alephium API is well-defined and consistent, making it easier for developers to build applications that interact with the Alephium network.",
