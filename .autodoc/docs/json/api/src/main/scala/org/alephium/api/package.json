  "summary": "This file defines a number of utility functions and types that are used throughout the Alephium project's API. \n\nThe file begins with a header that specifies the licensing terms for the code. Following this, the file defines a number of imports that are used throughout the rest of the file. \n\nThe `Try` type is redefined in this file to be an `Either` type that can hold either an `ApiError` or a successful result. This is used throughout the API to indicate whether a request was successful or not. \n\nThe file also defines a number of utility functions for creating `ApiError` objects. These functions are used to create errors that can be returned to the client in the event of a failure. \n\nThe `wrapResult` function is used to wrap an `IOResult` in a `Try`. This is used to convert an `IOResult` into a `Try` that can be returned to the client. \n\nThe `wrapExeResult` function is used to wrap an `ExeResult` in a `Try`. This is used to convert an `ExeResult` into a `Try` that can be returned to the client. \n\nThe `alphJsonBody` function is used to define an endpoint input/output that accepts/returns JSON data. This function uses the `readWriterCodec` function to define a codec for the specified type. \n\nThe `readWriterCodec` function is used to define a codec for a given type. This function uses the `upickle` library to serialize/deserialize the data. \n\nThe `alphPlainTextBody` function is used to define an endpoint input/output that accepts/returns plain text data. This function uses the `Codec.string` codec to define the input/output format. \n\nOverall, this file defines a number of utility functions and types that are used throughout the Alephium project's API. These functions are used to handle errors, wrap results, and define input/output formats for endpoints.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines a package object for the `org.alephium.api` package, which contains utility functions and type aliases for working with API errors and response bodies.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code file use?\n- This code file imports several libraries, including `sttp`, `org.alephium.io`, and `org.alephium.json`. It also defines a custom codec using `upickle`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `wrapResult` and `wrapExeResult` functions?\n- The `wrapResult` function takes an `IOResult` and returns a `Try` that either contains the result value or an `ApiError` if the result was an `IOError`. The `wrapExeResult` function takes an `ExeResult` and returns a `Try` that either contains the result value or an `ApiError` if the result was an `IOError` or a `VM` execution error."
