  "summary": "This file contains code for building and decoding a transaction for deploying a stateful smart contract on the Alephium blockchain. The `BuildDeployContractTx` class represents the transaction and contains various parameters such as the public key of the sender, the bytecode of the contract, the initial amount of Aleph tokens to be sent to the contract, and the gas price and amount for executing the transaction. The `decodeBytecode` method can be used to deserialize the bytecode into a `Code` object, which contains the contract itself as well as the initial values for its immutable and mutable fields.\n\nThe `Code` class represents the deserialized bytecode and contains the `StatefulContract` object representing the contract itself, as well as vectors of initial values for its immutable and mutable fields. The `serde` implicit value provides serialization and deserialization functionality for the `Code` class using the `Serde` library. The `validate` method is used to ensure that the deserialized `Code` object is valid, i.e. that the lengths of the initial immutable and mutable fields match the expected lengths for the contract.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to build and decode transactions for deploying stateful smart contracts on the Alephium blockchain. It is an important part of the Alephium project's functionality for executing smart contracts and interacting with the blockchain. An example usage of this code might look like:\n\n```scala\nval contractCode: ByteString = // bytecode for the contract\nval senderPublicKey: ByteString = // public key of the sender\nval initialAmount: Option[Amount] = // initial amount of Aleph tokens to send to the contract\nval gasPrice: Option[GasPrice] = // gas price for executing the transaction\nval gasAmount: Option[GasBox] = // gas amount for executing the transaction\n\nval deployTx = BuildDeployContractTx(\n  fromPublicKey = senderPublicKey,\n  bytecode = contractCode,\n  initialAttoAlphAmount = initialAmount,\n  gasPrice = gasPrice,\n  gasAmount = gasAmount\n)\n\nval decodedCode = deployTx.decodeBytecode().getOrElse(throw new Exception(\"Failed to decode bytecode\"))\n\n// interact with the contract using the decodedCode object\n```",
