  "summary": "The code in this file is part of the Alephium project and provides functionality for generating OpenAPI documentation from the Alephium API. OpenAPI is a widely used standard for describing RESTful APIs, which allows developers to understand and interact with the API more easily.\n\nThe main function in this file is `openApiJson`, which takes an `OpenAPI` object and a `dropAuth` boolean flag as input. It generates a JSON string representing the OpenAPI documentation. If `dropAuth` is set to true, the security fields in the OpenAPI object are removed before generating the JSON string.\n\nThe file also provides several utility functions for working with OpenAPI objects, such as `dropSecurityFields` for removing security fields from an OpenAPI object, `cleanOpenAPIResult` for cleaning up the generated JSON string, and `mapOperation` for mapping an operation on a `PathItem`.\n\nAdditionally, the file defines a number of implicit `Writer` instances for various OpenAPI-related classes, such as `Schema`, `Parameter`, `Response`, and `Operation`. These `Writer` instances are used to convert the corresponding objects into JSON format.\n\nHere's an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.api.OpenAPIWriters._\n\n// Assume we have an OpenAPI object representing the Alephium API\nval openAPI: OpenAPI = ...\n\n// Generate the OpenAPI JSON documentation without security fields\nval openApiJsonString: String = openApiJson(openAPI, dropAuth = true)\n```\n\nThis code would generate a JSON string representing the OpenAPI documentation for the Alephium API, with the security fields removed.",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `openApiJson` function and what does the `dropAuth` parameter do?\n\n   **Answer:** The `openApiJson` function takes an `OpenAPI` object and converts it into a JSON string. The `dropAuth` parameter is a boolean flag that, when set to true, removes the security fields from the OpenAPI object before converting it to JSON.\n\n2. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `cleanOpenAPIResult` function?\n\n   **Answer:** The `cleanOpenAPIResult` function takes an OpenAPI JSON string and replaces all occurrences of the `address.toBase58` with a modified version that has the last two characters removed. This is likely done to clean up the addresses in the OpenAPI documentation.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `expandExtensions` function?\n\n   **Answer:** The `expandExtensions` function is a helper function that takes a `Writer[T]` and returns a new `Writer[T]` that handles the serialization of extensions in the OpenAPI objects. It ensures that the extensions are properly serialized and included in the resulting JSON object."
