  "summary": "This code defines a set of Tapir schemas for various types used in the Alephium project. Tapir is a library for building HTTP APIs in Scala, and these schemas define the expected input and output types for the API endpoints.\n\nThe schemas cover a wide range of types, including addresses, hashes, public keys, signatures, timestamps, and more. For each type, a Tapir schema is defined that specifies the expected format of the data. For example, the `addressSchema` specifies that an address should be represented as a string in the format \"address\", while the `hashSchema` specifies that a hash should be represented as a string in the format \"32-byte-hash\".\n\nThese schemas are used throughout the Alephium project to ensure that data is properly formatted when passed between different components. For example, when an API endpoint receives an address as input, it can use the `addressSchema` to validate that the input is in the correct format. Similarly, when an API endpoint returns a hash as output, it can use the `hashSchema` to ensure that the hash is properly formatted before sending it back to the client.\n\nOverall, these Tapir schemas play an important role in ensuring that the Alephium API is well-defined and consistent, making it easier for developers to build applications that interact with the Alephium network.",
