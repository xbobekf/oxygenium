  "summary": "This code defines a case class called `PeerAddress` that represents the network address of a peer in the Alephium network. The `PeerAddress` class has four fields: `address`, which is an `InetAddress` object representing the IP address of the peer, `restPort`, which is an integer representing the port number for the peer's REST API, `wsPort`, which is an integer representing the port number for the peer's WebSocket API, and `minerApiPort`, which is an integer representing the port number for the peer's miner API.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger Alephium project to manage connections to other nodes in the network. When a node wants to connect to another node, it can create a `PeerAddress` object with the appropriate IP address and port numbers, and use this object to establish a connection. The `PeerAddress` class provides a convenient way to store and manage this information.\n\nHere is an example of how the `PeerAddress` class might be used in the Alephium project:\n\n```\nimport org.alephium.api.model.PeerAddress\n\nval peer = PeerAddress(InetAddress.getByName(\"192.168.1.100\"), 8080, 8081, 8082)\n\n// Use the peer object to establish a connection to the peer's REST API\nval restApi = new RestApi(peer.address, peer.restPort)\n\n// Use the peer object to establish a connection to the peer's WebSocket API\nval wsApi = new WebSocketApi(peer.address, peer.wsPort)\n\n// Use the peer object to establish a connection to the peer's miner API\nval minerApi = new MinerApi(peer.address, peer.minerApiPort)\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `PeerAddress` object representing a peer with IP address \"192.168.1.100\" and REST, WebSocket, and miner API ports 8080, 8081, and 8082, respectively. We then use this object to establish connections to the peer's REST, WebSocket, and miner APIs.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a case class called `PeerAddress` which represents the address of a peer in the Alephium network.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n   - This code imports `java.net.InetAddress`, so it depends on the Java standard library.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
