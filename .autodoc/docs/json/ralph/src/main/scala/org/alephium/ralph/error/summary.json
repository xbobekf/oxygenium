      "summary": "This file contains code related to typed compiler errors for the Alephium project. The code defines a set of error messages that can be produced by the compiler, which are used to provide feedback to the user when there is an issue with their code. \n\nThe `CompilerError` trait is the base trait for all compiler errors, and it defines a `message` method that returns a string representation of the error. The `FormattableError` trait extends `CompilerError` and adds additional methods for formatting the error message. The `SyntaxError` and `TypeError` traits extend `FormattableError` and define specific types of errors that can occur during compilation. \n\nThe `FastParseError` case class is used to represent errors produced by the FastParse library, which is used for parsing the Alephium language. It contains information about the position of the error in the program, the error message, the found input, and a traced message. The `Expected an I256 value` and `Expected an U256 value` case classes are used to represent errors where an integer value is expected but a different type of value is found. The `Expected an immutable variable` case class is used to represent errors where a mutable variable is used in a context where an immutable variable is expected. The `Expected main statements` case class is used to represent errors where the main statements for a type are missing. The `Expected non-empty asset(s) for address` case class is used to represent errors where an address is missing assets. The `Expected else statement` case class is used to represent errors where an `else` statement is expected but not found. The `Invalid byteVec`, `Invalid number`, `Invalid contract address`, and `Invalid address` case classes are used to represent errors where a value of the wrong type is used. \n\nOverall, this code provides a set of error messages that can be used to provide feedback to users when there is an issue with their code during compilation. These error messages can be used to help users identify and fix issues in their code more easily.",

The module is part of the Alephium project and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe `FastParseErrorUtil` object provides two functions: `apply` and `getLatestErrorMessage`. The `apply` function takes a `Parsed.TracedFailure` object as input and returns a `CompilerError.FastParseError` object. The `Parsed.TracedFailure` object is a result of a failed parsing operation using the FastParser library. The `CompilerError.FastParseError` object is a custom error type defined in the Alephium project that represents a parsing error. The `apply` function extracts relevant information from the `Parsed.TracedFailure` object and constructs a `CompilerError.FastParseError` object.\n\nThe `getLatestErrorMessage` function takes a `Parsed.TracedFailure` object and an integer index as input and returns a string that represents the most recent error message for the given index. The function is used by the `apply` function to extract the expected error message.\n\nThe `FastParseErrorUtil` object is used in the Alephium project to handle parsing errors that occur during compilation of Alephium code. The `apply` function is called whenever a parsing error occurs and constructs a custom error object that can be used to provide more detailed error messages to the user. The `getLatestErrorMessage` function is used by the `apply` function to extract the expected error message from the `Parsed.TracedFailure` object.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.ralph.error.FastParseErrorUtil\nimport fastparse.Parsed\n\nval input = \"1 + 2 * 3\"\nval result = fastparse.parse(input, Parser.expr(_))\n\nresult match {\n  case Parsed.Success(value, _) => println(value)\n  case Parsed.Failure(traced) => {\n    val error = FastParseErrorUtil(traced)\n    println(error.message)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `fastparse.parse` function is used to parse the input string `1 + 2 * 3` using a parser defined in the `Parser` object. If the parsing is successful, the result is printed to the console. If the parsing fails, the `FastParseErrorUtil` object is used to construct a custom error object that contains more detailed error information. The error message is printed to the console.",

The `fastparse` library provides a way to define parsers in a concise and easy-to-read way. The `LastIndex` method provided by the `FastParseExtension` object is used to get the last index of a parser run without ignoring whitespaces. \n\nThe `LastIndex` method takes a `parser` and a `ctx` as input parameters. The `parser` is a parser with a unit result, and the `ctx` is the current parser context. The method returns the tail/last index after the parser run. \n\nThis method can be used in the larger project to parse input data and extract relevant information. For example, if the project requires parsing a string to extract a specific value, the `fastparse` library can be used to define a parser for the string, and the `LastIndex` method can be used to get the last index of the parser run. This information can then be used to extract the relevant value from the string. \n\nHere is an example of how the `LastIndex` method can be used:\n\n```\nimport fastparse._\nimport org.alephium.ralph.error.FastParseExtension._\n\nval parser = P(\"hello\" ~ \"world\").rep(1)\nval input = \"hello world hello world\"\n\nval result = parser.parse(input)\nval lastIndex = LastIndex(parser)(result)\n\nprintln(lastIndex) // Output: 23\n```\n\nIn this example, the `parser` is defined to parse the input string for the sequence \"hello world\" one or more times. The `input` string contains two occurrences of the sequence \"hello world\". The `parser` is run on the `input` string using the `parse` method provided by the `fastparse` library. The `result` variable contains the result of the parser run. The `LastIndex` method is then called with the `parser` and `result` as input parameters to get the last index of the parser run. The `lastIndex` variable contains the last index of the parser run, which is 23.",
