  "summary": "This script is used to update the version number of the alephium project and create a new git tag for the release. The script takes a single argument, which is the new version number in the format of X.Y.Z(-postfix), where X, Y, and Z are integers and postfix is an optional string. \n\nThe script first checks if the new version number is valid by matching it against a regular expression. If the version number is invalid, the script exits with an error message. \n\nNext, the script checks if the current branch is either \"master\" or in the format of X.Y.x, where X and Y are integers and x is any string. This is to ensure that the version number is only updated on the main branch or a release branch. If the current branch is not valid, the script exits with an error message. \n\nThe script then checks if there are any uncommitted changes in the branch. If there are uncommitted changes, the script exits with an error message. \n\nAfter the checks, the script updates the version number in two files: \"openapi.json\" and all JSON files in the \"ralphc/src/test/resources\" directory. The script uses the \"sed\" command to replace the old version number with the new version number in the files. The script uses different \"sed\" commands depending on the operating system. \n\nFinally, the script adds all changes to git, creates a new git tag with the new version number, and pushes the changes to the remote repository. \n\nThis script is useful for automating the versioning process of the alephium project. By running this script, developers can easily update the version number and create a new release without having to manually update the version number in multiple files and create a git tag. \n\nExample usage: \n\n```\n./update_version.sh 1.2.3\n```\n\nThis command updates the version number to \"1.2.3\" and creates a new git tag \"v1.2.3\".",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this script?\n   \n   This script is used to update the version number in various files, commit the changes, and create a new tag for the specified version.\n\n2. What are the requirements for the version number argument?\n   \n   The version number argument must be in the format of X.Y.Z(-optional_postfix), where X, Y, and Z are integers. If the argument does not meet this requirement, the script will exit with an error message.\n\n3. What files are being updated by this script?\n   \n   This script updates the version number in the `openapi.json` file and all `.json` files located in the `ralphc/src/test/resources` directory."
