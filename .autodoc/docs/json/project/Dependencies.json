  "summary": "This file contains two Scala objects: `Version` and `Dependencies`. These objects define the versions of various libraries and dependencies used in the Alephium project. \n\nThe `Version` object defines the versions of the following libraries: \n- Akka\n- Tapir\n- Sttp\n- Apispec\n- Prometheus\n\nThe `Dependencies` object defines the dependencies used in the project. These include:\n- Akka: `akka-actor`, `akka-slf4j`, and `akka-testkit`\n- Vert.x: `vertx-core`\n- Upickle: `upickle`\n- Ficus: `ficus`\n- Bouncy Castle: `bcprov-jdk18on`\n- Fastparse: `fastparse`\n- Logback: `logback-classic`\n- RocksDB: `rocksdbjni`\n- Scala Logging: `scala-logging`\n- ScalaCheck: `scalacheck`\n- ScalaTest: `scalatest`\n- ScalaTestPlus: `scalacheck-1-14`\n- WeUPnP: `weupnp`\n- Tapir: `tapir-core`, `tapir-server`, `tapir-vertx-server`, `tapir-openapi-docs`, `tapir-openapi-model`, `tapir-swagger-ui`, and `tapir-sttp-client`\n- Sttp: `async-http-client-backend-future`\n- Prometheus: `simpleclient`, `simpleclient_common`, and `simpleclient_hotspot`\n- Scopt: `scopt`\n\nThese dependencies are used throughout the Alephium project to provide various functionality, such as networking, logging, testing, and more. For example, the `akka-actor` library is used to implement the actor model in the project, while `tapir` is used to define and document the API endpoints. \n\nOverall, this file serves as a central location for defining the versions and dependencies used in the Alephium project, making it easier to manage and update them as needed.",
  "questions": "1. What licensing terms apply to this code?\n- The code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.\n\n2. What are the versions of the various dependencies used in this project?\n- The versions of the dependencies are listed in the `Version` object, and are referenced in the `Dependencies` object.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `tapir` library and how is it used in this project?\n- The `tapir` library is used for building HTTP APIs, and is used in this project for defining and serving HTTP endpoints. It is referenced in the `Dependencies` object and its various components are used throughout the codebase."
