It extends the `BaseEndpoint` trait and uses the `SttpClientInterpreter` to create requests. The class takes an optional `ApiKey` parameter and an `ExecutionContext` parameter in its constructor.\n\nThe `createRequest` method takes an endpoint, its parameters, and a URI, and returns a request object that can be sent to the endpoint. The `send` method takes an endpoint, its parameters, and a URI, and sends the request to the endpoint using the `AsyncHttpClientFutureBackend`. It returns a `Future` that contains the response from the endpoint.\n\nThe `handleDecodeFailures` method is a private method that is used to handle decoding failures that may occur when decoding the response from the endpoint. If the decoding is successful, it returns the decoded value. If there is an error, it logs the error and returns an `ApiError.InternalServerError` with the error message.\n\nThe `startSelfOnce` and `stopSelfOnce` methods are used to start and stop the `EndpointSender` service. The `subServices` method returns an empty `ArraySeq`.\n\nOverall, the `EndpointSender` class provides a convenient way to send HTTP requests to endpoints defined in the Alephium project. It handles decoding failures and provides a simple interface for sending requests and receiving responses.",

The `VertxFutureServerOptions` class is imported from the `sttp.tapir.server.vertx` package. This class provides options for configuring a server that uses the Vert.x framework.\n\nThe `ServerOptions` object also extends a trait called `DecodeFailureHandler`, which is defined in another file in the `org.alephium.api` package. This trait provides a method called `myDecodeFailureHandler` that handles decoding failures when parsing HTTP requests.\n\nThe `serverOptions` value is initialized by calling the `customiseInterceptors` method on a `VertxFutureServerOptions` instance. This method returns a builder object that allows for customizing the server options. The `decodeFailureHandler` method is called on the builder object, passing in the `myDecodeFailureHandler` method as an argument. This sets the decode failure handler for the server options.\n\nFinally, the `options` method is called on the builder object to build the `VertxFutureServerOptions` instance with the custom interceptors.\n\nThis code is used to configure the server options for the Alephium project's HTTP server. By customizing the interceptors, the project can handle decoding failures in a specific way. The `ServerOptions` object can be imported and used in other parts of the project to access the `VertxFutureServerOptions` instance and its configured options. For example, it could be used to start the HTTP server with the custom interceptors:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.http.ServerOptions\n\nval server = VertxServerBuilder\n  .newBuilder[Future]\n  .withOptions(ServerOptions.serverOptions)\n  .build(new MyApiEndpoints)\n```",

Swagger UI is a tool that allows users to interact with a RESTful API by providing a web-based interface for exploring the API's endpoints and parameters. \n\nThe `SwaggerUI` object provides a set of endpoints that serve the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI specification. The OpenAPI specification is a machine-readable format for describing RESTful APIs. The Swagger UI is generated from the OpenAPI specification and provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the API.\n\nThe `SwaggerUI` object provides four endpoints:\n\n1. `openapiEndpoint`: This endpoint serves the OpenAPI specification as a JSON string. The OpenAPI specification is generated by the application and passed to the `SwaggerUI` object as a parameter.\n\n2. `redirectToSlashEndpoint`: This endpoint redirects requests to the Swagger UI to the root of the Swagger UI endpoint. This is useful for handling requests that do not include a trailing slash.\n\n3. `swaggerInitializerJsEndpoint`: This endpoint serves the JavaScript code that initializes the Swagger UI. The JavaScript code is generated by the `SwaggerUI` object and includes the URL of the OpenAPI specification.\n\n4. `resourcesEndpoint`: This endpoint serves the static resources required by the Swagger UI, such as CSS files and images.\n\nThe `SwaggerUI` object uses the `sttp.tapir` library to define the server endpoints. The `sttp.tapir` library provides a type-safe way to define HTTP endpoints in Scala. The `SwaggerUI` object also uses the `org.alephium.util.AVector` class to store the endpoints. The `AVector` class is a custom implementation of a vector that is optimized for small vectors.\n\nHere is an example of how the `SwaggerUI` object can be used to serve a Swagger UI:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.http.SwaggerUI\nimport org.alephium.util.AVector\n\nval openapiContent: String = ???\nval contextPath: String = \"docs\"\nval openapiFileName: String = \"openapi.json\"\n\nval endpoints: AVector[ServerEndpoint[Any, Future]] = SwaggerUI(openapiContent, contextPath, openapiFileName)\n```",

By customizing the interceptors, the project can handle decoding failures in a specific way. The `ServerOptions` object can be imported and used in other parts of the project to access the `VertxFutureServerOptions` instance and its configured options. For example, it could be used to start the HTTP server with the custom interceptors:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.http.ServerOptions\n\nval server = VertxServerBuilder\n  .newBuilder[Future]\n  .withOptions(ServerOptions.serverOptions)\n  .build(new MyApiEndpoints)\n```\n\n`SwaggerUI.scala` provides a set of server endpoints for serving a Swagger UI, which allows users to interact with a RESTful API by providing a web-based interface for exploring the API's endpoints and parameters. You can use the `SwaggerUI` object to serve a Swagger UI for your API:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.http.SwaggerUI\nimport org.alephium.util.AVector\n\nval openapiContent: String = ???\nval contextPath: String = \"docs\"\nval openapiFileName: String = \"openapi.json\"\n\nval endpoints: AVector[ServerEndpoint[Any, Future]] = SwaggerUI(openapiContent, contextPath, openapiFileName)\n```\n\nIn summary, this folder contains essential components for handling HTTP requests and responses in the Alephium project. The `EndpointSender` class simplifies sending requests to endpoints, while the `ServerOptions` object configures the server options for handling decoding failures. The `SwaggerUI` object provides a set of server endpoints for serving a Swagger UI, allowing users to interact with the API through a web-based interface. These components work together to provide a robust and user-friendly HTTP layer for the Alephium project.",
