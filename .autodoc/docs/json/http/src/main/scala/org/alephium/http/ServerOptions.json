  "summary": "This code defines an object called `ServerOptions` that contains a `VertxFutureServerOptions` instance. The `VertxFutureServerOptions` class is imported from the `sttp.tapir.server.vertx` package. This class provides options for configuring a server that uses the Vert.x framework.\n\nThe `ServerOptions` object also extends a trait called `DecodeFailureHandler`, which is defined in another file in the `org.alephium.api` package. This trait provides a method called `myDecodeFailureHandler` that handles decoding failures when parsing HTTP requests.\n\nThe `serverOptions` value is initialized by calling the `customiseInterceptors` method on a `VertxFutureServerOptions` instance. This method returns a builder object that allows for customizing the server options. The `decodeFailureHandler` method is called on the builder object, passing in the `myDecodeFailureHandler` method as an argument. This sets the decode failure handler for the server options.\n\nFinally, the `options` method is called on the builder object to build the `VertxFutureServerOptions` instance with the custom interceptors.\n\nThis code is used to configure the server options for the Alephium project's HTTP server. By customizing the interceptors, the project can handle decoding failures in a specific way. The `ServerOptions` object can be imported and used in other parts of the project to access the `VertxFutureServerOptions` instance and its configured options. For example, it could be used to start the HTTP server with the custom interceptors:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.http.ServerOptions\n\nval server = VertxServerBuilder\n  .newBuilder[Future]\n  .withOptions(ServerOptions.serverOptions)\n  .build(new MyApiEndpoints)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n   - This code file is defining server options for the Alephium project's HTTP API.\n\n2. What is the license for this code?\n   - This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.\n\n3. What is the role of the `DecodeFailureHandler` trait in this code?\n   - The `DecodeFailureHandler` trait is being extended by the `ServerOptions` object to provide a custom decode failure handler for the HTTP API."
