  "summary": "The `EndpointSender` class is a part of the Alephium project and is used to send HTTP requests to endpoints defined in the project. It extends the `BaseEndpoint` trait and uses the `SttpClientInterpreter` to create requests. The class takes an optional `ApiKey` parameter and an `ExecutionContext` parameter in its constructor.\n\nThe `createRequest` method takes an endpoint, its parameters, and a URI, and returns a request object that can be sent to the endpoint. The `send` method takes an endpoint, its parameters, and a URI, and sends the request to the endpoint using the `AsyncHttpClientFutureBackend`. It returns a `Future` that contains the response from the endpoint.\n\nThe `handleDecodeFailures` method is a private method that is used to handle decoding failures that may occur when decoding the response from the endpoint. If the decoding is successful, it returns the decoded value. If there is an error, it logs the error and returns an `ApiError.InternalServerError` with the error message.\n\nThe `startSelfOnce` and `stopSelfOnce` methods are used to start and stop the `EndpointSender` service. The `subServices` method returns an empty `ArraySeq`.\n\nOverall, the `EndpointSender` class provides a convenient way to send HTTP requests to endpoints defined in the Alephium project. It handles decoding failures and provides a simple interface for sending requests and receiving responses.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code defines a class `EndpointSender` that creates and sends HTTP requests to a server using the `sttp` library. It also handles decoding errors and logs them.\n\n2. What external libraries does this code use?\n   \n   This code uses the `sttp` library for sending HTTP requests, `sttp.tapir` for defining endpoints, `com.typesafe.scalalogging` for logging, and `org.alephium` for other utility classes.\n\n3. What is the license for this code?\n   \n   This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
