  "summary": "The `SwaggerUI` object is a Scala class that provides a set of server endpoints for serving a Swagger UI. Swagger UI is a tool that allows users to interact with a RESTful API by providing a web-based interface for exploring the API's endpoints and parameters. \n\nThe `SwaggerUI` object provides a set of endpoints that serve the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI specification. The OpenAPI specification is a machine-readable format for describing RESTful APIs. The Swagger UI is generated from the OpenAPI specification and provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the API.\n\nThe `SwaggerUI` object provides four endpoints:\n\n1. `openapiEndpoint`: This endpoint serves the OpenAPI specification as a JSON string. The OpenAPI specification is generated by the application and passed to the `SwaggerUI` object as a parameter.\n\n2. `redirectToSlashEndpoint`: This endpoint redirects requests to the Swagger UI to the root of the Swagger UI endpoint. This is useful for handling requests that do not include a trailing slash.\n\n3. `swaggerInitializerJsEndpoint`: This endpoint serves the JavaScript code that initializes the Swagger UI. The JavaScript code is generated by the `SwaggerUI` object and includes the URL of the OpenAPI specification.\n\n4. `resourcesEndpoint`: This endpoint serves the static resources required by the Swagger UI, such as CSS files and images.\n\nThe `SwaggerUI` object uses the `sttp.tapir` library to define the server endpoints. The `sttp.tapir` library provides a type-safe way to define HTTP endpoints in Scala. The `SwaggerUI` object also uses the `org.alephium.util.AVector` class to store the endpoints. The `AVector` class is a custom implementation of a vector that is optimized for small vectors.\n\nHere is an example of how the `SwaggerUI` object can be used to serve a Swagger UI:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.http.SwaggerUI\nimport org.alephium.util.AVector\n\nval openapiContent: String = ???\nval contextPath: String = \"docs\"\nval openapiFileName: String = \"openapi.json\"\n\nval endpoints: AVector[ServerEndpoint[Any, Future]] = SwaggerUI(openapiContent, contextPath, openapiFileName)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an object called `SwaggerUI` that provides a set of server endpoints for serving Swagger UI documentation for an OpenAPI specification.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on the `sttp` and `tapir` libraries for defining server endpoints and handling HTTP requests and responses.\n\n3. What is the license for this code?\n- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
