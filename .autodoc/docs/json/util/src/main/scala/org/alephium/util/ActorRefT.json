  "summary": "This file contains the implementation of the `ActorRefT` class and its companion object. The purpose of this class is to provide a type-safe wrapper around an `ActorRef` instance, which is a reference to an actor in the Akka actor system. \n\nThe `ActorRefT` class provides several methods that allow sending messages to the actor referenced by the `ActorRef` instance. These methods include `!`, `forward`, `ask`, and `tell`. The `!` method sends a message of type `T` to the actor, while the `forward` method forwards the message to another actor. The `ask` method sends a message and returns a `Future` that will be completed with the response from the actor. The `tell` method sends a message to the actor with an explicit sender.\n\nThe `ActorRefT` class also overrides the `equals` and `hashCode` methods to provide equality comparison based on the underlying `ActorRef` instance.\n\nThe companion object provides factory methods for creating instances of `ActorRefT`. The `apply` method creates an instance from an existing `ActorRef` instance, while the `build` methods create a new actor and return an `ActorRefT` instance that references it. The `build` method with two arguments creates an actor with a given name.\n\nThis class is likely used throughout the Alephium project to interact with actors in a type-safe manner. For example, a message can be sent to an actor of type `MyActor` using the following code:\n\n```\nval myActorRef: ActorRef = ...\nval myActor: ActorRefT[MyActor.Message] = ActorRefT(myActorRef)\nmyActor ! MyActor.Message(\"hello\")\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a class `ActorRefT` and an object `ActorRefT` in the `org.alephium.util` package, which provide additional functionality to Akka `ActorRef`s.\n\n2. What is the license for this code?\n   - This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.\n\n3. What are some of the additional methods provided by the `ActorRefT` class?\n   - The `ActorRefT` class provides methods for sending messages (`!`, `tell`, `forward`) and asking for a response (`ask`) using an Akka `ActorRef`."
