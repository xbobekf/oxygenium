  "summary": "The code above defines a utility object called `Utils` that provides a single method called `getStackTrace`. This method takes a `Throwable` object as input and returns a string representation of the stack trace associated with the exception. \n\nThe stack trace is a list of method calls that were active at the time the exception was thrown, along with the file name and line number where each method was called. This information is useful for debugging purposes, as it can help developers identify the root cause of an error.\n\nThe `getStackTrace` method works by creating a new `StringWriter` object and a `PrintWriter` object that writes to the `StringWriter`. The `Throwable` object's stack trace is then printed to the `PrintWriter`, which in turn writes it to the `StringWriter`. Finally, the `toString` method is called on the `StringWriter` to obtain the stack trace as a string.\n\nThis utility method can be used throughout the `alephium` project to provide detailed error messages when exceptions are thrown. For example, if an exception is caught in a method, the `getStackTrace` method can be called to obtain the stack trace and include it in the error message that is logged or displayed to the user. \n\nHere is an example of how the `getStackTrace` method might be used:\n\n```\ntry {\n  // some code that might throw an exception\n} catch {\n  case e: Exception =>\n    val stackTrace = Utils.getStackTrace(e)\n    logger.error(s\"An error occurred: ${e.getMessage}\\n$stackTrace\")\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if an exception is caught, the `getStackTrace` method is called to obtain the stack trace as a string, which is then included in the error message that is logged by the `logger`. This can help developers diagnose and fix the underlying issue that caused the exception to be thrown.",
