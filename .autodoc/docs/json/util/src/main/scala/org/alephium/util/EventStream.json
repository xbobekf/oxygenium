  "summary": "This code defines a trait called `EventStream` which provides functionality for publishing and subscribing to events in an Akka actor system. The `EventStream` trait extends two other traits: `Publisher` and `Subscriber`. \n\nThe `Publisher` trait defines a method `publishEvent` which takes an `Event` object and an implicit `ActorContext` as arguments. The method publishes the event to the actor system's event stream using the `publish` method of the `eventStream` object. \n\nThe `Subscriber` trait defines two methods: `subscribeEvent` and `unsubscribeEvent`. Both methods take an `ActorRef` and a `Class[_ <: Event]` as arguments, as well as an implicit `ActorContext`. The `subscribeEvent` method subscribes the actor to the specified event channel using the `subscribe` method of the `eventStream` object. The `unsubscribeEvent` method unsubscribes the actor from the specified event channel using the `unsubscribe` method of the `eventStream` object. \n\nThe `Event` trait is a marker trait that is used to identify event classes. It does not define any methods or properties. \n\nThis code can be used in an Akka-based application to implement a publish-subscribe pattern for events. For example, an application might define a custom event class `MyEvent` that extends the `Event` trait, and then use the `EventStream` trait to publish and subscribe to instances of `MyEvent`. \n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used:\n\n```scala\nimport akka.actor._\nimport org.alephium.util.EventStream\n\ncase class MyEvent(data: String) extends EventStream.Event\n\nclass MyActor extends Actor with EventStream.Subscriber {\n  override def preStart(): Unit = {\n    subscribeEvent(self, classOf[MyEvent])\n  }\n\n  override def postStop(): Unit = {\n    unsubscribeEvent(self, classOf[MyEvent])\n  }\n\n  override def receive: Receive = {\n    case MyEvent(data) =>\n      println(s\"Received event with data: $data\")\n  }\n}\n\nobject MyApp extends App {\n  val system = ActorSystem(\"MySystem\")\n  val actor = system.actorOf(Props[MyActor], \"MyActor\")\n\n  actor ! MyEvent(\"Hello, world!\")\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, an `ActorSystem` is created and a `MyActor` instance is created and subscribed to the `MyEvent` channel. When the `MyEvent` message is sent to the actor, it will print \"Received event with data: Hello, world!\" to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `EventStream` trait and how is it used?\n   - The `EventStream` trait defines a publisher-subscriber pattern for events and can be mixed in with other traits or classes to provide event publishing and subscription functionality.\n2. What is the relationship between the `EventStream` trait and Akka actors?\n   - The `EventStream` trait uses the `ActorContext` to access the Akka system's event stream and publish or subscribe to events.\n3. What license is this code released under?\n   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, either version 3 or any later version."
