  "summary": "This code defines a custom exception class called `AppException` in the `org.alephium.util` package. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to throw exceptions specific to the Alephium project with a custom message.\n\nThe `AppException` class extends the built-in `Exception` class and takes a single parameter, `message`, which is a string that describes the reason for the exception. This message can be customized for each instance of the exception, allowing for more informative error messages.\n\nThis class can be used throughout the Alephium project to handle errors and exceptions in a consistent way. For example, if a function encounters an error that it cannot handle, it can throw an `AppException` with a descriptive message to indicate what went wrong. This can help with debugging and troubleshooting issues in the project.\n\nHere is an example of how this class could be used in a function:\n\n```\ndef divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {\n  if (b == 0) {\n    throw new AppException(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n  }\n  a / b\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if the `b` parameter is zero, the function will throw an `AppException` with the message \"Cannot divide by zero\". This allows the calling code to handle the exception in a meaningful way, such as displaying an error message to the user or logging the error for later analysis.\n\nOverall, the `AppException` class provides a way to handle errors and exceptions in a consistent and informative way throughout the Alephium project.",
