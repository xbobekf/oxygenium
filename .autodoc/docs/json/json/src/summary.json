It is implemented using the `upickle` library, which is a lightweight JSON serialization library for Scala. This file is essential for serializing and deserializing JSON data, as well as manipulating JSON objects within the Alephium project.\n\nThe `Json` object provides several implicit conversions for working with JSON data:\n\n- `fromString`: This method is an implicit conversion that converts a `String` to a `ujson.Value`. For example, if you have a JSON string `val jsonString = \"\"\"{\"key\": \"value\"}\"\"\"`, you can convert it to a `ujson.Value` using `val jsonValue = Json.fromString(jsonString)`.\n\n- `OptionWriter` and `OptionReader`: These methods are implicit conversions that provide serialization and deserialization support for `Option` types. For instance, if you have a case class `case class Example(id: Int, name: Option[String])`, you can use `OptionWriter` and `OptionReader` to serialize and deserialize instances of this case class to and from JSON.\n\n- `readOpt`: This utility method reads a JSON value and returns an `Option` of the specified type. If the JSON value cannot be parsed or is missing a required field, `None` is returned. For example, if you have a JSON object `val jsonObject = ujson.Obj(\"id\" -> 1, \"name\" -> \"John\")`, you can use `readOpt` to extract the `name` field as an `Option[String]`: `val nameOpt = Json.readOpt[String](jsonObject, \"name\")`.\n\nThe `dropNullValues` method is a utility method that removes null values from a JSON object. It recursively traverses the JSON object and removes any null values it encounters. If the entire object is null, the method returns `ujson.Null`. For example, if you have a JSON object with null values like `val jsonObjectWithNulls = ujson.Obj(\"id\" -> 1, \"name\" -> null)`, you can remove the null values using `val jsonObjectWithoutNulls = Json.dropNullValues(jsonObjectWithNulls)`.\n\nIn summary, the `Json.scala` file provides essential utility functions for working with JSON data in the Alephium project. These functions can be used to serialize and deserialize JSON data, as well as manipulate JSON objects. This file is crucial for handling JSON data within the Alephium project and works in conjunction with other parts of the project that require JSON processing.",
