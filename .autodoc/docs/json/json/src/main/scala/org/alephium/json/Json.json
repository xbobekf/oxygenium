  "summary": "The `Json` object in the `org.alephium.json` package provides utility functions for working with JSON data. The object is implemented using the `upickle` library, which is a lightweight JSON serialization library for Scala.\n\nThe `Json` object provides several implicit conversions for working with JSON data. The `fromString` method is an implicit conversion that converts a `String` to a `ujson.Value`. The `OptionWriter` and `OptionReader` methods are implicit conversions that provide serialization and deserialization support for `Option` types. The `readOpt` method is a utility method that reads a JSON value and returns an `Option` of the specified type. If the JSON value cannot be parsed or is missing a required field, `None` is returned.\n\nThe `dropNullValues` method is a utility method that removes null values from a JSON object. The method recursively traverses the JSON object and removes any null values it encounters. If the entire object is null, the method returns `ujson.Null`.\n\nOverall, the `Json` object provides a set of utility methods for working with JSON data in the Alephium project. These methods can be used to serialize and deserialize JSON data, as well as manipulate JSON objects.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file is a Scala object that provides utilities for working with JSON data.\n\n2. What external libraries does this code file depend on?\n- This code file depends on the `ujson` library for parsing and manipulating JSON data.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `dropNullValues` method?\n- The `dropNullValues` method recursively removes all null values from a given JSON object or array, returning a new JSON object or array without the null values."
