  "summary": "This file contains the implementation of the `CliqueInfo` class, which represents information about a clique in the Alephium protocol. A clique is a group of brokers that work together to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain. \n\nThe `CliqueInfo` class contains the following fields:\n- `id`: a unique identifier for the clique\n- `externalAddresses`: a vector of optional external addresses for each broker in the clique\n- `internalAddresses`: a vector of internal addresses for each broker in the clique\n- `groupNumPerBroker`: the number of groups assigned to each broker\n- `priKey`: the private key used by the clique to sign messages\n\nThe `CliqueInfo` class provides several methods to access and manipulate this information. \n\nThe `brokerNum` method returns the number of brokers in the clique. \n\nThe `cliqueConfig` method returns a `CliqueConfig` object that contains information about the clique's configuration, including the number of brokers and the number of groups. \n\nThe `intraBrokers` method returns a vector of `BrokerInfo` objects that represent the brokers in the clique. \n\nThe `coordinatorAddress` method returns the internal address of the coordinator broker in the clique. \n\nThe `selfInterBrokerInfo` method returns an `InterBrokerInfo` object that represents the clique's inter-broker information. \n\nThe `selfBrokerInfo` method returns an optional `BrokerInfo` object that represents the current broker's information. \n\nThe `interBrokers` method returns an optional vector of `BrokerInfo` objects that represent the external addresses of the brokers in the clique. \n\nThe `CliqueInfo` class also provides a `validate` method that checks whether the clique information is valid according to the given `GroupConfig` object. \n\nThe `CliqueInfo` class is used in the Alephium protocol to manage the configuration and communication of cliques. It provides a convenient way to access and manipulate information about the brokers in a clique, and to validate that the clique information is consistent with the overall group configuration.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CliqueInfo` class?\n- The `CliqueInfo` class represents information about a clique, which is a group of brokers in the Alephium protocol.\n2. What is the significance of the `groupNumPerBroker` parameter?\n- The `groupNumPerBroker` parameter determines the number of groups assigned to each broker in the clique.\n3. What is the purpose of the `validate` method in the `CliqueInfo` companion object?\n- The `validate` method checks whether the number of groups in the `CliqueInfo` object matches the number of groups specified in the `GroupConfig` object, and returns an error message if they do not match."
