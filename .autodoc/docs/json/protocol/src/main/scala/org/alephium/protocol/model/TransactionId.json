  "summary": "This file contains the implementation of the `TransactionId` class and its companion object. The `TransactionId` class is a wrapper around a `Hash` value and is used to represent the unique identifier of a transaction in the Alephium blockchain. The `TransactionId` class is defined as a `final case class` which means that it is immutable and has a default implementation of `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods. The `TransactionId` class extends the `RandomBytes` trait which provides a `bytes` method that returns the byte representation of the `Hash` value.\n\nThe companion object of the `TransactionId` class provides several utility methods for creating, hashing, and serializing `TransactionId` instances. The `TransactionId` object extends the `HashUtils` trait which provides the `hash` and `from` methods for hashing and deserializing `Hash` values. The `TransactionId` object defines an implicit `Serde` instance for serializing and deserializing `TransactionId` instances. The `TransactionId` object also defines an implicit `Ordering` instance for comparing `TransactionId` instances based on their byte representation.\n\nThe `TransactionId` object provides several factory methods for creating `TransactionId` instances. The `zero` method returns a `TransactionId` instance with a zero `Hash` value. The `length` method returns the length of the `Hash` value in bytes. The `generate` method generates a new random `TransactionId` instance. The `from` method deserializes a `TransactionId` instance from a byte string. The `hash` methods compute the `Hash` value of a byte sequence or a string and return a new `TransactionId` instance with the computed `Hash` value. The `unsafe` method creates a new `TransactionId` instance from a given `Hash` value.\n\nOverall, this file provides the implementation of the `TransactionId` class and its companion object which are used to represent the unique identifier of a transaction in the Alephium blockchain. The `TransactionId` class is a simple wrapper around a `Hash` value and provides a byte representation of the `Hash` value. The companion object provides several utility methods for creating, hashing, and serializing `TransactionId` instances. These methods are used throughout the Alephium project to manipulate and store transaction identifiers.",
