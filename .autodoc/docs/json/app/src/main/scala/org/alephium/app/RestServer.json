  "summary": "The `RestServer` class is a REST API server that exposes various endpoints for interacting with the Alephium blockchain. It is built using the Vert.x web framework and uses the Tapir library for defining and handling endpoints. \n\nThe `RestServer` class takes in a `Node` object, which represents a node in the Alephium network, a `Miner` object, which is responsible for mining new blocks, a `BlocksExporter` object, which is used for exporting blocks, and an optional `WalletServer` object, which represents a wallet server. It also takes in various configuration objects such as `BrokerConfig` and `ApiConfig`.\n\nThe `RestServer` class extends several traits, including `EndpointsLogic`, `Documentation`, `Service`, `VertxFutureServerInterpreter`, and `StrictLogging`. These traits provide various functionality such as defining endpoint logic, generating documentation, and logging.\n\nThe `RestServer` class defines several routes for interacting with the Alephium blockchain. These routes include endpoints for getting node information, getting block information, building and submitting transactions, and interacting with contracts. It also includes endpoints for mining blocks, exporting blocks, and checking the status of the mempool.\n\nThe `RestServer` class uses the `Vertx` class to create an HTTP server and a `Router` object to define routes. It also uses the `CorsHandler` class to handle CORS requests. \n\nOverall, the `RestServer` class is a key component of the Alephium project, providing a REST API for interacting with the blockchain. It is designed to be extensible and configurable, allowing developers to easily add new endpoints and customize the behavior of the server.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a REST server for the Alephium project, which exposes various endpoints related to the blockchain and wallet functionality.\n\n2. What external libraries or frameworks does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries and frameworks, including Vert.x, Tapir, and Scala Logging.\n\n3. What endpoints are available through this REST server?\n- This code defines a large number of endpoints, including those related to node information, block and transaction retrieval, wallet functionality, contract execution, and more. The available endpoints are defined in the `blockFlowRoute` and `walletServer` variables."
