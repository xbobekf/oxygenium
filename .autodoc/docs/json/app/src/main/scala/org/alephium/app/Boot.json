  "summary": "The `Boot` object is the entry point of the Alephium application. It initializes the system by calling the `BootUp` class, which is responsible for setting up the application environment. \n\nThe `BootUp` class loads the Alephium configuration from the `typesafeConfig` object, which is a configuration library for JVM languages. It then initializes the `ActorSystem` and `Server` objects, which are used to manage the application's concurrency and HTTP server, respectively. \n\nThe `init()` method is called to start the application. It first checks the compatibility of the database, then registers the default Hotspot (JVM) collectors for Prometheus, logs the configuration, and starts the server. Finally, it adds a shutdown hook to stop the application gracefully. \n\nThe `checkDatabaseCompatibility()` method checks the compatibility of the database by calling the `nodeStateStorage.checkDatabaseCompatibility()` method. If the compatibility check fails, the application exits with an error. \n\nThe `logConfig()` method logs the Alephium and Akka configurations. It also logs the genesis digests, which are the unique identifiers of the initial blocks of the blockchain. \n\nThe `collectBuildInfo()` method collects the build information of the application and logs it. \n\nOverall, the `Boot` and `BootUp` objects are responsible for initializing the Alephium application environment and starting the server. They also provide methods for checking the compatibility of the database, logging the configuration, and collecting the build information.",
