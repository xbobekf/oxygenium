  "summary": "The `WebSocketServer` class is responsible for creating and managing a WebSocket server that listens for incoming connections on a specified port. The server is used to stream events related to the Alephium blockchain to clients that connect to it. \n\nThe class takes in a `Node` object, which is an instance of the `Node` class from the `org.alephium.flow.client` package. The `Node` class is responsible for managing the connection to the Alephium network and provides access to various APIs that can be used to interact with the blockchain. \n\nThe `WebSocketServer` class extends the `ApiModelCodec` trait, which provides methods for encoding and decoding JSON objects to and from case classes that represent the API models used by the Alephium blockchain. It also extends the `StrictLogging` trait, which provides logging capabilities using the `com.typesafe.scalalogging` library. \n\nThe `WebSocketServer` class creates an instance of the `Vertx` class from the `io.vertx.core` package, which is used to create a WebSocket server that listens for incoming connections. It also creates an instance of the `HttpServer` class from the `io.vertx.core.http` package, which is used to handle incoming WebSocket requests. \n\nThe `WebSocketServer` class defines an `eventHandler` actor that is responsible for handling events related to the Alephium blockchain. The actor subscribes to the `node.eventBus` object, which is an instance of the `EventBus` class from the `org.alephium.util` package. The `EventBus` class is used to publish and subscribe to events related to the Alephium blockchain. \n\nThe `WebSocketServer` class defines a `server` object that is used to handle incoming WebSocket requests. The `server` object listens for incoming connections on the specified port and interface. When a connection is established, the `server` object checks if the path of the WebSocket request is `/events`. If it is, the `server` object subscribes the `eventHandler` actor to the WebSocket connection. If it is not, the `server` object rejects the WebSocket connection. \n\nThe `WebSocketServer` class defines a `startSelfOnce` method that is used to start the WebSocket server. The method binds the `server` object to the specified port and interface and returns a `Future` that completes when the server is successfully bound. \n\nThe `WebSocketServer` class defines a `stopSelfOnce` method that is used to stop the WebSocket server. The method closes the `server` object and returns a `Future` that completes when the server is successfully closed. \n\nThe `WebSocketServer` class also defines several companion objects and methods that are used to handle events related to the Alephium blockchain. The `EventHandler` object defines an actor that is responsible for handling events related to the Alephium blockchain. The `handleEvent` method is used to encode events to JSON objects that can be sent to clients over the WebSocket connection. The `blockNotifyEncode` method is used to encode block notifications to JSON objects that can be sent to clients over the WebSocket connection.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   Answer: This code defines a WebSocket server that listens for events and sends notifications to subscribers. It is part of the Alephium project and uses Akka actors, Vert.x, and Tapir.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code rely on?\n   Answer: This code relies on several dependencies including Akka, Vert.x, Tapir, and Alephium-specific libraries such as org.alephium.api and org.alephium.flow.\n\n3. What is the significance of the GNU Lesser General Public License mentioned in the comments?\n   Answer: The GNU Lesser General Public License is a type of open-source software license that allows users to modify and distribute the software under certain conditions. This code is licensed under this license, which means that users have certain rights and responsibilities when using and modifying the code."
