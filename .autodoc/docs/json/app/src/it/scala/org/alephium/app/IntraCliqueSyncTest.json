  "summary": "This file contains code for testing the synchronization of nodes within a clique in the Alephium project. The code defines a class called `IntraCliqueSyncTest` which extends `AlephiumActorSpec`, a class used for testing actors in the Alephium project. \n\nThe `IntraCliqueSyncTest` class contains two test cases. The first test case checks if a single node clique can be booted and synced. The second test case checks if a two node clique can be booted and synced. \n\nIn both test cases, the `bootNode` method is used to start a new node with a specified public port and broker ID. The `mineAndAndOneBlock` method is used to mine a block and add it to the blockchain. The `eventually` method is used to wait for certain conditions to be met before proceeding with the test. \n\nThe first test case starts a single node clique and waits for it to become ready. Once the node is ready, the test stops the node. \n\nThe second test case starts two nodes in a clique and mines blocks on the first node until the second node is unable to sync with the first node. Once the second node is unable to sync, the test starts the second node and waits for it to become ready. Once the second node is ready, the test checks that both nodes contain the same blocks in their blockchains. Finally, the test stops both nodes. \n\nThis code is used to test the synchronization of nodes within a clique in the Alephium project. It ensures that nodes can be started and synced correctly, and that the blockchain is consistent across all nodes in the clique.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `IntraCliqueSyncTest` class?\n- The `IntraCliqueSyncTest` class is a test class that tests the synchronization of nodes within a clique.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports `sttp.model.StatusCode` and uses classes from `org.alephium.api.model`, `org.alephium.protocol.model`, and `org.alephium.util`.\n\n3. What is the expected behavior of the `it should \"boot and sync two nodes clique\"` test case?\n- The `it should \"boot and sync two nodes clique\"` test case is expected to boot two nodes in a clique, mine blocks, synchronize the blocks between the two nodes, and then stop the nodes."
