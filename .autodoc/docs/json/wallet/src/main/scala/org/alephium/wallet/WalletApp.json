  "summary": "The `WalletApp` class is a component of the Alephium project that provides a wallet service. It is responsible for starting and stopping the wallet service, which listens for HTTP requests on a specified port. The wallet service provides a RESTful API for interacting with the Alephium blockchain. \n\nThe `WalletApp` class is initialized with a `WalletConfig` object, which contains configuration parameters for the wallet service, such as the port to listen on and the location of the secret directory. The `WalletApp` class extends the `Service` trait, which is a common interface for all components in the Alephium project. \n\nThe `WalletApp` class creates an instance of the `BlockFlowClient` class, which is responsible for communicating with the Alephium blockchain. It also creates an instance of the `WalletService` class, which provides the core functionality of the wallet service, such as creating and managing wallets. \n\nThe `WalletApp` class creates an instance of the `WalletServer` class, which is responsible for handling HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate handlers. The `WalletServer` class defines a set of routes that correspond to the RESTful API provided by the wallet service. \n\nThe `WalletApp` class starts an HTTP server using the Vert.x framework, which listens for HTTP requests on the specified port. It creates a `Router` object that is used to define the routes for the wallet service. It also creates a `CorsHandler` object that is used to handle cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) requests. \n\nThe `WalletApp` class defines a set of routes that are used to handle HTTP requests. These routes are defined using the `Route` class, which is a wrapper around the Vert.x `Route` class. The `Route` class provides a simple way to define HTTP routes using a DSL-like syntax. \n\nThe `WalletApp` class provides methods for starting and stopping the wallet service. The `startSelfOnce` method starts the wallet service by creating an HTTP server and registering the routes defined by the `WalletServer` class. The `stopSelfOnce` method stops the wallet service by closing the HTTP server. \n\nOverall, the `WalletApp` class provides a simple and flexible way to create a wallet service that can be used to interact with the Alephium blockchain. It provides a RESTful API that can be used to create and manage wallets, and it can be easily integrated into other applications that need to interact with the Alephium blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a WalletApp class that sets up a web server for a wallet service using the Alephium blockchain.\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n   - This code imports several dependencies, including Vertx, Tapir, and Scalalogging.\n3. What configuration options are available for this wallet service?\n   - The WalletConfig object passed to the WalletApp constructor specifies options such as the port to listen on, the location of secret files, and the timeout for locking transactions."
