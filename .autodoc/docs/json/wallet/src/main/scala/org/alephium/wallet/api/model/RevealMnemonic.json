  "summary": "This file contains two case classes, `RevealMnemonic` and `RevealMnemonicResult`, which are used in the `org.alephium.wallet.api` package of the Alephium project. \n\n`RevealMnemonic` takes a single parameter, `password`, which is a string. This case class is used to reveal the mnemonic associated with a wallet. A mnemonic is a sequence of words that can be used to recover a wallet's private key. The `password` parameter is used to decrypt the mnemonic, which is stored in an encrypted format. \n\n`RevealMnemonicResult` takes a single parameter, `mnemonic`, which is an instance of the `Mnemonic` class from the `org.alephium.crypto.wallet` package. This case class is used to return the decrypted mnemonic to the caller. \n\nThese case classes are likely used in the context of a REST API endpoint that allows a user to reveal their mnemonic. The endpoint would receive a request containing the user's password, and would use the `RevealMnemonic` case class to decrypt the mnemonic. The decrypted mnemonic would then be returned to the user in a response containing an instance of the `RevealMnemonicResult` case class. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval password = \"mysecretpassword\"\nval revealMnemonic = RevealMnemonic(password)\nval mnemonic = decryptMnemonic(revealMnemonic)\nval revealMnemonicResult = RevealMnemonicResult(mnemonic)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n   - This code file contains a case class and a final case class for revealing a mnemonic, likely for use in a cryptocurrency wallet API.\n\n2. What is the license for this code?\n   - This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.\n\n3. What is the `Mnemonic` class imported from?\n   - The `Mnemonic` class is imported from the `org.alephium.crypto.wallet` package, which suggests it is related to cryptocurrency wallet functionality."
