  "summary": "This file contains code for the Transfer model and related classes used in the Alephium wallet API. The Transfer model represents a transfer of funds from one or more source addresses to one or more destination addresses. It contains a list of Destination objects, which represent the destination addresses and the amount of funds to be transferred to each address. \n\nThe Transfer model also contains optional fields for specifying gas and gas price, which are used to pay for the computational resources required to execute the transaction on the Alephium network. The utxosLimit field is also optional and can be used to limit the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that can be used as inputs to the transaction.\n\nThe TransferResult class represents the result of a transfer transaction and contains the transaction ID, as well as the source and destination group indices. The TransferResults class is a wrapper around a list of TransferResult objects and provides a convenience method for creating a TransferResults object from a list of tuples containing the transaction ID and group indices.\n\nThis code is an important part of the Alephium wallet API, as it provides a way for users to initiate transfers of funds on the Alephium network. The Transfer model can be used to construct transfer requests, which can then be sent to the Alephium network for processing. The TransferResult and TransferResults classes provide a way for users to retrieve information about the status of their transfer requests and to track the progress of their transactions. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport org.alephium.wallet.api.model.Transfer\nimport org.alephium.api.model.Destination\nimport org.alephium.protocol.vm.GasBox\nimport org.alephium.protocol.vm.GasPrice\nimport org.alephium.util.AVector\n\n// Create a transfer request with two destinations and gas and gas price specified\nval destinations = AVector(Destination(\"address1\", 100), Destination(\"address2\", 200))\nval gasBox = GasBox(1000, 10000)\nval gasPrice = GasPrice(100)\nval transfer = Transfer(destinations, Some(gasBox), Some(gasPrice))\n\n// Send the transfer request to the Alephium network for processing\nval transferResult = alephiumApi.sendTransfer(transfer)\n\n// Retrieve the transaction ID and group indices from the transfer result\nval txId = transferResult.txId\nval fromGroup = transferResult.fromGroup\nval toGroup = transferResult.toGroup\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Transfer` class and what parameters does it take?\n- The `Transfer` class represents a transfer of funds and takes in a vector of `Destination` objects, as well as optional parameters for `gas`, `gasPrice`, and `utxosLimit`.\n2. What is the `TransferResult` class and how is it related to the `Transfer` class?\n- The `TransferResult` class represents the result of a transfer and includes the transaction ID, as well as the group indices of the sender and receiver. It is related to the `Transfer` class in that it is returned as part of the `TransferResults` object.\n3. What is the purpose of the `TransferResults` object and how is it constructed?\n- The `TransferResults` object represents the results of multiple transfers and is constructed from a vector of tuples containing the transaction ID and group indices. It includes a method `from` that converts the input vector into a vector of `TransferResult` objects."
