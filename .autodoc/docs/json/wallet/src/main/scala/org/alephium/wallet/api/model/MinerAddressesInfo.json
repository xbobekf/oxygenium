  "summary": "The code defines a case class called `MinerAddressesInfo` which contains a single field called `addresses` of type `AVector[AddressInfo]`. \n\n`AVector` is a custom vector implementation provided by the `org.alephium.util` package. It is similar to the standard library's `Vector` but with some additional functionality and optimizations specific to the Alephium project.\n\n`AddressInfo` is likely another case class that contains information about a specific address, such as its public key, balance, and transaction history.\n\nThis code is likely used in the Alephium wallet API to provide information about the addresses controlled by a miner. When a miner starts mining, they must specify which addresses they want to mine for. This information is then stored on the blockchain and can be queried by other nodes on the network.\n\nThe `MinerAddressesInfo` case class is likely used as a response object for an API endpoint that returns this information. For example, the endpoint `/api/miner/addresses` might return a JSON object with a single field called `addresses` that contains an array of `AddressInfo` objects.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:\n\n```scala\nimport org.alephium.wallet.api.model.MinerAddressesInfo\nimport org.alephium.util.AVector\n\nval addresses = AVector(AddressInfo(\"address1\"), AddressInfo(\"address2\"))\nval minerAddressesInfo = MinerAddressesInfo(addresses)\n\n// Use the minerAddressesInfo object to return information about a miner's addresses\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `MinerAddressesInfo` case class?\n   - The `MinerAddressesInfo` case class is used to represent information about miner addresses, specifically a vector of `AddressInfo` objects.\n\n2. What is the `AVector` type used for in this code?\n   - The `AVector` type is used to represent a vector (i.e. an ordered collection) of `AddressInfo` objects.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
