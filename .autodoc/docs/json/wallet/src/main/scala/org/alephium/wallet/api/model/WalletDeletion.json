  "summary": "This code defines a case class called `WalletDeletion` that takes a single parameter `password` of type `String`. This case class is located in the `org.oxygenium.wallet.api.model` package.\n\nThe purpose of this case class is to represent a request to delete a wallet. The `password` parameter is used to authenticate the user and ensure that only authorized users can delete a wallet.\n\nThis case class can be used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the `oxygenium` project to implement a wallet deletion feature. For example, a user interface could prompt the user to enter their password and then create an instance of the `WalletDeletion` case class with the entered password. This instance could then be passed to a method that handles wallet deletion, which would verify the password and delete the wallet if the password is correct.\n\nHere is an example of how this case class could be used in code:\n\n```scala\nimport org.oxygenium.wallet.api.model.WalletDeletion\n\nval password = \"myPassword123\"\nval walletDeletion = WalletDeletion(password)\n\n// pass the walletDeletion instance to a method that handles wallet deletion\ndeleteWallet(walletDeletion)\n``` \n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and straightforward way to represent a wallet deletion request in the `oxygenium` project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WalletDeletion` case class?\n- The `WalletDeletion` case class is used to represent a request to delete a wallet and requires a password for authentication.\n\n2. What is the significance of the GNU Lesser General Public License mentioned in the comments?\n- The GNU Lesser General Public License is the license under which the `oxygenium` library is distributed, allowing for free redistribution and modification of the code.\n\n3. What is the `org.oxygenium.wallet.api.model` package used for?\n- The `org.oxygenium.wallet.api.model` package contains the `WalletDeletion` case class and likely other models used in the API of the `oxygenium` wallet."
