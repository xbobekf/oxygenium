  "summary": "This file contains code for the `WalletExamples` trait, which provides examples of various API requests and responses for the Alephium wallet. The trait imports several classes and objects from other parts of the Alephium project, including `Amount`, `Mnemonic`, `PublicKey`, `GroupConfig`, and `Hex`. \n\nThe `WalletExamples` trait defines several implicit `Example` objects, which are used to generate example requests and responses for the Alephium wallet API. These examples include requests to create, restore, unlock, and delete wallets, as well as requests to transfer funds, reveal mnemonics, and change active addresses. \n\nFor example, the `walletCreationExamples` implicit defines three examples of `WalletCreation` requests, which include a password, wallet name, and optional mnemonic passphrase. These examples are intended to demonstrate how different types of users might create a wallet, such as a regular user or a miner. \n\nThe `WalletExamples` trait also defines several other implicit `Example` objects for different types of requests and responses, such as `Balances`, `Transfer`, and `Sign`. These examples are used to generate sample requests and responses for the Alephium wallet API, which can be helpful for developers who are integrating the wallet into their own applications. \n\nOverall, the `WalletExamples` trait provides a useful set of examples for developers who are working with the Alephium wallet API. By defining implicit `Example` objects for various types of requests and responses, the trait makes it easy for developers to generate sample code and test their integrations with the Alephium wallet.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines examples for various API endpoints related to wallet functionality in the Alephium project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `groupConfig` object?\n- The `groupConfig` object provides a configuration for the number of groups in the Alephium network.\n\n3. What are some examples of API endpoints that are defined in this code?\n- Some examples of API endpoints defined in this code include wallet creation, restoration, status, unlocking, deletion, balance retrieval, address management, and transaction signing and transfer."
