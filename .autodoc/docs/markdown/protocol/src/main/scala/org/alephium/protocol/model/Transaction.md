This file contains code related to transactions in the Alephium project. The `TransactionAbstract` trait defines common methods and properties for transactions, such as `id`, `fromGroup`, `toGroup`, `gasFeeUnsafe`, `outputsLength`, and `getOutput`. It also defines the `assetOutputRefs` method, which returns a vector of `AssetOutputRef` objects for each output in the transaction.

The `Transaction` case class extends `TransactionAbstract` and represents a transaction in the Alephium blockchain. It contains the unsigned transaction, a flag indicating whether the script execution was successful, a vector of contract output references, a vector of generated outputs, a vector of input signatures, and a vector of script signatures. It also implements the `MerkleHashable` trait, which allows it to be included in Merkle trees.

The `Transaction` object provides several factory methods for creating transactions, including `from`, which creates a transaction from inputs, outputs, and a private key, and `coinbase`, which creates a coinbase transaction for a given chain index, block timestamp, and target. The `genesis` method creates a genesis transaction with a vector of balances and a proof of no pre-mine.

The `TransactionTemplate` case class represents a transaction template, which is a transaction without signatures. It contains the unsigned transaction, a vector of input signatures, and a vector of script signatures. The `TransactionTemplate` object provides a factory method for creating a transaction template from an unsigned transaction and a private key.

Overall, this code provides the basic functionality for creating and manipulating transactions in the Alephium blockchain. It is an essential part of the project's core functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionAbstract` trait and its methods?
- The `TransactionAbstract` trait defines common methods and properties that are shared by all types of transactions. The methods include getting the transaction ID, calculating gas fees, and accessing transaction outputs.

2. What is the difference between a `Transaction` and a `TransactionTemplate`?
- A `Transaction` represents a fully constructed and signed transaction, while a `TransactionTemplate` represents an unsigned transaction with input signatures and script signatures that can be used to construct a `Transaction`.

3. What is the purpose of the `coinbase` method in the `Transaction` object?
- The `coinbase` method is used to create a coinbase transaction, which is a special type of transaction that is used to reward miners for adding a new block to the blockchain. It calculates the mining reward and creates an output with the appropriate lockup script and lock time.
