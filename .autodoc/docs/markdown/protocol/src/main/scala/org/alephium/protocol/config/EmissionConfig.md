This code defines a trait called `EmissionConfig` that is used to configure the emission of new tokens in the Oxygenium blockchain. The `Emission` class is imported from the `org.oxygenium.protocol.mining` package and is used as the return type for the `emission` method defined in the trait.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to configure the emission of new tokens in the Oxygenium blockchain. The `Emission` class defines the rules for how new tokens are created and distributed in the network. By implementing the `EmissionConfig` trait, developers can customize the emission rules to suit their needs.

For example, a developer could create a new class that extends the `EmissionConfig` trait and overrides the `emission` method to return a custom `Emission` object. This custom object could define different emission rules, such as a different rate of token creation or a different distribution mechanism.

Overall, this code is an important part of the Oxygenium blockchain project as it allows developers to customize the emission of new tokens to suit their specific use case.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EmissionConfig` trait?
   - The `EmissionConfig` trait defines a method `emission` that returns an instance of `Emission`, which is related to mining rewards in the Oxygenium protocol.

2. What is the relationship between this code and the GNU Lesser General Public License?
   - This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, which allows for the free distribution and modification of the library, but with no warranty and certain restrictions.

3. What other files or packages might be related to this code?
   - Other files or packages related to this code might include those related to mining, as the `Emission` class is related to mining rewards, and those related to the overall configuration of the Oxygenium protocol.
