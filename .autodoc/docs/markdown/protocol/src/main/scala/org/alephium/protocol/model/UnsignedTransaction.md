The `UnsignedTransaction` code is part of the Alephium project and represents an unsigned transaction in the blockchain. It is used to create, validate, and manipulate transactions before they are signed and added to the blockchain.

The `UnsignedTransaction` case class contains the following fields:

- `version`: The version of the transaction.
- `networkId`: The ID of the chain that can accept the transaction.
- `scriptOpt`: An optional script for invoking stateful contracts.
- `gasAmount`: The amount of gas that can be used for transaction execution.
- `gasPrice`: The price of gas for the transaction.
- `inputs`: A vector of transaction inputs.
- `fixedOutputs`: A vector of transaction outputs, with contract outputs placed before asset outputs.

The `UnsignedTransaction` object provides several methods for creating and validating unsigned transactions, such as:

- `apply`: Creates an unsigned transaction with the given parameters.
- `coinbase`: Creates a coinbase transaction, which is a special type of transaction used to reward miners.
- `build`: Builds an unsigned transaction from the given input and output information.
- `approve`: Approves a transaction with a stateful script, owner, inputs, and outputs.

The code also includes helper methods for checking transaction validity, calculating the total amount of tokens and ALPH (the native cryptocurrency) needed for a transaction, and building transaction outputs.

For example, to create an unsigned transaction, you can use the `apply` method:

```scala
val unsignedTx = UnsignedTransaction(
  scriptOpt = None,
  gasAmount = minimalGas,
  gasPrice = nonCoinbaseMinGasPrice,
  inputs = AVector(input1, input2),
  fixedOutputs = AVector(output1, output2)
)
```

Overall, the `UnsignedTransaction` code plays a crucial role in the Alephium project by providing the necessary functionality for creating and validating transactions before they are added to the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `UnsignedTransaction` case class and its associated methods?
   **Answer**: The `UnsignedTransaction` case class represents an unsigned transaction in the Alephium project. It contains information such as the transaction version, network ID, optional script for invoking stateful contracts, gas amount and price, inputs, and fixed outputs. The associated methods provide functionality for creating, validating, and manipulating unsigned transactions.

2. **Question**: How does the `build` method work and what are its inputs and outputs?
   **Answer**: The `build` method is used to create an `UnsignedTransaction` from the provided inputs, such as the lockup and unlock scripts, input UTXOs, output information, gas amount, and gas price. It performs various checks and calculations to ensure the transaction is valid and returns an `Either[String, UnsignedTransaction]`, which is a success case containing the created `UnsignedTransaction` or a failure case with an error message.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TxOutputInfo` case class and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `TxOutputInfo` case class represents the information required for a transaction output, including the lockup script, atto ALPH amount, tokens, lock time, and optional additional data. It is used in various methods, such as `buildOutputs`, `checkMinimalAlphPerOutput`, and `checkTokenValuesNonZero`, to create, validate, and manipulate transaction outputs.
