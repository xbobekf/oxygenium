This file contains the implementation of the `ContractId` class and its companion object. The `ContractId` class represents the identifier of a smart contract in the Alephium blockchain. It is a wrapper around a `Hash` value and is defined as a value class, which means that it has no runtime overhead. 

The `ContractId` class provides several methods to manipulate contract identifiers. The `bytes` method returns the byte representation of the identifier. The `groupIndex` method returns the index of the group to which the contract belongs. The `subContractId` method returns a new contract identifier that represents a sub-contract of the current contract. Finally, the `inaccurateFirstOutputRef` method returns the first output reference of the contract, which is used to identify the contract's output in a transaction.

The companion object of the `ContractId` class provides several factory methods to create contract identifiers. The `generate` method creates a new random contract identifier. The `from` method creates a contract identifier from a byte string. The `hash` methods create a contract identifier from a byte sequence or a string. The `deprecatedFrom` method creates a contract identifier from a transaction identifier and an output index. The `subContract` methods create a sub-contract identifier from a pre-image and a group index. Finally, the `unsafe` method creates a contract identifier from a `Hash` value.

Overall, the `ContractId` class and its companion object are essential components of the Alephium blockchain, as they provide a way to identify and manipulate smart contracts. They are used extensively throughout the codebase to implement various features of the blockchain, such as contract creation, execution, and validation. Here is an example of how to create a new contract identifier:

```scala
val contractId = ContractId.generate
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ContractId` class and how is it used in the `alephium` project?
   - The `ContractId` class represents a unique identifier for a smart contract in the `alephium` project. It is used to generate, manipulate, and retrieve contract IDs from various sources.
2. What is the significance of the `groupIndex` method in the `ContractId` class?
   - The `groupIndex` method returns the group index associated with a given contract ID, which is used to determine the shard on which the contract is stored in the `alephium` network.
3. What is the purpose of the `lemanUnsafe` method in the `ContractId` object?
   - The `lemanUnsafe` method is used to generate a new contract ID from a deprecated contract ID and a group index, as part of a network upgrade in the `alephium` project. It is marked as "unsafe" because it assumes that the input contract ID is in a specific format that is no longer used in the upgraded network.
