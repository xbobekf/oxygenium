The code defines a trait called `DiscoveryConfig` which contains various configuration parameters related to peer discovery in the Alephium project. 

The `scanFrequency` parameter specifies the wait time between two scans, while `scanFastFrequency` and `fastScanPeriod` are used to configure a faster scan mode. `initialDiscoveryPeriod` specifies the duration of the initial discovery phase. 

The `neighborsPerGroup` parameter sets the maximum number of peers returned from a query, and `maxCliqueFromSameIp` sets the maximum number of peers allowed from the same IP address. 

The `peersTimeout` parameter sets the duration after which a peer is considered unreachable if it does not respond to a query. The `expireDuration` parameter is calculated as 10 times the `scanFrequency` and is used to determine when a peer should be removed from the list of known peers. Finally, `unreachableDuration` sets the duration after which a peer is considered unreachable if it has not been seen for that amount of time. 

This trait is likely used by other components in the Alephium project that are responsible for peer discovery and management. For example, a peer discovery module may use these configuration parameters to determine how often to scan for new peers, how many peers to query at once, and how long to wait for a response before considering a peer unreachable. 

Here is an example of how this trait may be used in code:

```scala
import org.alephium.protocol.config.DiscoveryConfig

class PeerDiscovery(config: DiscoveryConfig) {
  // Use the `scanFrequency` parameter to determine how often to scan for new peers
  val scanInterval = config.scanFrequency

  // Use the `neighborsPerGroup` parameter to determine how many peers to query at once
  val querySize = config.neighborsPerGroup

  // Use the `peersTimeout` parameter to determine how long to wait for a response from a peer
  val queryTimeout = config.peersTimeout

  // ...
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DiscoveryConfig` trait?
- The `DiscoveryConfig` trait defines a set of configuration parameters related to network discovery in the Alephium protocol.

2. What are the meanings of the `scanFrequency`, `scanFastFrequency`, and `fastScanPeriod` parameters?
- `scanFrequency` is the time interval between two network scans, `scanFastFrequency` is the time interval between two fast network scans, and `fastScanPeriod` is the duration of a fast network scan.

3. What is the significance of the `unreachableDuration` parameter?
- The `unreachableDuration` parameter specifies the duration after which a peer is considered unreachable if it does not respond to network queries.
