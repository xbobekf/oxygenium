This file contains a package object that defines various constants and values used throughout the Alephium project. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for these values, making it easier to manage and update them as needed.

Some of the constants defined in this file include the default block and transaction versions, the length of the clique ID, and various gas-related values such as the minimal gas required for a transaction, the gas price for coinbase transactions, and the maximal gas per block and transaction.

Other constants include the maximal code size for contracts and fields, the dust UTXO amount, and the maximum number of tokens per contract and asset UTXO.

The code also defines an implicit ordering for hashes, which is used to sort hashes based on their byte values.

Overall, this code is an important part of the Alephium project as it provides a centralized location for important constants and values used throughout the project. By defining these values in one place, it makes it easier to manage and update them as needed, which can help to improve the overall efficiency and functionality of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains constants and values related to the Alephium protocol model.

2. What is the significance of the `DefaultBlockVersion` and `DefaultTxVersion` values?
- `DefaultBlockVersion` and `DefaultTxVersion` are constants that define the default version numbers for blocks and transactions in the Alephium protocol.

3. What is the purpose of the `maximalGasPerTx` value?
- `maximalGasPerTx` is a constant that defines the maximum amount of gas that can be used by a single transaction in a block in the Alephium protocol.
