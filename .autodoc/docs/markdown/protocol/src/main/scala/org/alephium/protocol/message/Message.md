This file contains the implementation of the `Message` class and related methods. The `Message` class represents a message that can be sent over the network in the Alephium project. The message consists of a header, payload, and checksum. The header contains the current wire version, which is used to ensure compatibility between different versions of the software. The payload contains the actual data being sent. The checksum is used to ensure the integrity of the message during transmission.

The `Message` class has a constructor that takes a `Header` and a `Payload` object. It also has a factory method that takes a `Payload` object and creates a new `Message` object with a header containing the current wire version. This is a convenience method that simplifies the creation of new messages.

The `Message` class also has two methods for serializing messages. The `serialize` method takes a `Message` object and returns a `ByteString` that can be sent over the network. The `serialize` method that takes a `Payload` object is a convenience method that creates a new `Message` object and then serializes it. Both methods use the `MessageSerde` object to calculate the checksum and length of the message.

The `Message` class also has a `deserialize` method that takes a `ByteString` and returns a `Message` object. This method uses the `MessageSerde` object to extract the checksum, length, header, and payload from the input `ByteString`. It then checks the checksum to ensure the integrity of the message and deserializes the header and payload. If the deserialization is successful, it returns a `Message` object. Otherwise, it returns a `SerdeError`.

Overall, this file provides the functionality to create, serialize, and deserialize messages that can be sent over the network in the Alephium project. It is an important part of the networking layer of the project and is used extensively throughout the codebase. Below is an example of how to use the `Message` class to create and serialize a new message:

```scala
import org.alephium.protocol.message.{Message, Payload}

case class MyPayload(data: String) extends Payload

val payload = MyPayload("Hello, world!")
val message = Message(payload)

val serialized = Message.serialize(message)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Message` class and how is it used?
- The `Message` class represents a message with a header, payload, and checksum. It can be serialized and deserialized using the provided methods.

2. What is the `NetworkConfig` class and how is it used in this file?
- The `NetworkConfig` class is used to provide the magic bytes for the network, which are included in the serialized message. It is an implicit parameter for the `serialize` and `deserialize` methods.

3. What is the `SerdeResult` type and how is it used in this file?
- The `SerdeResult` type is a custom result type used for serialization and deserialization. It can either contain a successful result with a value, or an error with a message. It is used in the `deserialize` and `_deserialize` methods to handle errors and return the deserialized message.
