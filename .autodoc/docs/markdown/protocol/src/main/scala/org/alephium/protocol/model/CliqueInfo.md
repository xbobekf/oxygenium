This file contains the implementation of the `CliqueInfo` class, which represents information about a clique in the Alephium protocol. A clique is a group of brokers that work together to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain. 

The `CliqueInfo` class contains the following fields:
- `id`: a unique identifier for the clique
- `externalAddresses`: a vector of optional external addresses for each broker in the clique
- `internalAddresses`: a vector of internal addresses for each broker in the clique
- `groupNumPerBroker`: the number of groups assigned to each broker
- `priKey`: the private key used by the clique to sign messages

The `CliqueInfo` class provides several methods to access and manipulate this information. 

The `brokerNum` method returns the number of brokers in the clique. 

The `cliqueConfig` method returns a `CliqueConfig` object that contains information about the clique's configuration, including the number of brokers and the number of groups. 

The `intraBrokers` method returns a vector of `BrokerInfo` objects that represent the brokers in the clique. 

The `coordinatorAddress` method returns the internal address of the coordinator broker in the clique. 

The `selfInterBrokerInfo` method returns an `InterBrokerInfo` object that represents the clique's inter-broker information. 

The `selfBrokerInfo` method returns an optional `BrokerInfo` object that represents the current broker's information. 

The `interBrokers` method returns an optional vector of `BrokerInfo` objects that represent the external addresses of the brokers in the clique. 

The `CliqueInfo` class also provides a `validate` method that checks whether the clique information is valid according to the given `GroupConfig` object. 

The `CliqueInfo` class is used in the Alephium protocol to manage the configuration and communication of cliques. It provides a convenient way to access and manipulate information about the brokers in a clique, and to validate that the clique information is consistent with the overall group configuration.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CliqueInfo` class?
- The `CliqueInfo` class represents information about a clique, which is a group of brokers in the Alephium protocol.
2. What is the significance of the `groupNumPerBroker` parameter?
- The `groupNumPerBroker` parameter determines the number of groups assigned to each broker in the clique.
3. What is the purpose of the `validate` method in the `CliqueInfo` companion object?
- The `validate` method checks whether the number of groups in the `CliqueInfo` object matches the number of groups specified in the `GroupConfig` object, and returns an error message if they do not match.
