This file contains the implementation of the gas schedule for the Alephium virtual machine (VM). The gas schedule defines the cost of executing each operation in the VM. The gas cost is used to limit the amount of computation that can be performed by a transaction, preventing malicious actors from executing expensive operations that could slow down the network.

The gas schedule is defined as a set of traits that extend the `GasSchedule` trait. There are two types of gas schedules: `GasSimple` and `GasFormula`. `GasSimple` defines a fixed gas cost for an operation, while `GasFormula` defines a gas cost that depends on the size of the input data.

The gas schedule is implemented using the `GasBox` class, which represents a fixed amount of gas. The `GasBox` class is used to perform arithmetic operations on gas values, such as addition and multiplication.

The gas schedule includes gas costs for various operations, such as `GasMulModN`, `GasAddModN`, `GasHash`, `GasBytesEq`, `GasBytesConcat`, `GasBytesSlice`, `GasEncode`, `GasZeros`, `GasSignature`, `GasEcRecover`, `GasCreate`, `GasCopyCreate`, `GasContractExists`, `GasDestroy`, `GasMigrate`, `GasLoadContractFields`, `GasBalance`, `GasCall`, `GasLog`, and `GasUniqueAddress`.

The gas schedule also includes constants such as `callGas`, `contractLoadGas`, `contractStateUpdateBaseGas`, `txBaseGas`, `txInputBaseGas`, `txOutputBaseGas`, and `p2pkUnlockGas`. These constants are used to calculate the gas cost of various operations.

Overall, this file is an important part of the Alephium project, as it defines the gas schedule for the VM, which is a critical component of the blockchain. The gas schedule ensures that transactions are executed efficiently and securely, preventing malicious actors from exploiting the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GasSchedule` trait and its sub-traits?
- The `GasSchedule` trait and its sub-traits define the gas cost for various operations in the Alephium virtual machine.

2. What is the difference between `GasSimple` and `GasFormula` traits?
- `GasSimple` defines a fixed gas cost for an operation, while `GasFormula` defines a gas cost formula based on the size of the input.

3. What is the purpose of the `GasSchedule.txBaseGas` and its related constants?
- `GasSchedule.txBaseGas` defines the fixed base gas cost for a transaction in Alephium, while its related constants define the gas cost for various parts of a transaction such as inputs, outputs, and unlocking scripts.
