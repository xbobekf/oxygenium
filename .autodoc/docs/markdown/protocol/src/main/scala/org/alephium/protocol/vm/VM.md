This code defines the Virtual Machine (VM) for the Alephium project, which is responsible for executing smart contracts in a blockchain environment. The VM is implemented as an abstract class `VM[Ctx <: StatelessContext]` with two concrete implementations: `StatelessVM` and `StatefulVM`. The `StatelessVM` is used for executing stateless scripts, while the `StatefulVM` is used for executing stateful scripts that interact with the blockchain state.

The main method for executing a contract is `execute(obj: ContractObj[Ctx], methodIndex: Int, args: AVector[Val])`. It takes a `ContractObj`, a method index, and a vector of arguments as input and returns an `ExeResult[Unit]`. The method first checks if the contract code is valid, then starts a new frame for the method execution and pushes it onto the frame stack. It then executes the frames until the stack is empty.

The `StatelessVM` and `StatefulVM` classes provide their own implementations for starting a new frame and handling the execution of payable and non-payable methods. The `StatefulVM` also handles the management of contract balances and the generation of transaction outputs.

The `VM` object provides utility methods for checking code size, field size, and contract Atto Alph amounts. It also defines the `AssetScriptExecution` and `TxScriptExecution` case classes, which represent the results of executing asset and transaction scripts, respectively.

Example usage of the VM can be found in the `StatelessVM` and `StatefulVM` companion objects, which provide methods for running asset and transaction scripts, such as `runAssetScript` and `runTxScript`. These methods take a blockchain environment, transaction environment, initial gas, and script as input and return the execution result.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `VM` class and its subclasses `StatelessVM` and `StatefulVM`?
   **Answer**: The `VM` class represents a virtual machine for executing Alephium smart contracts. The subclasses `StatelessVM` and `StatefulVM` represent stateless and stateful virtual machines, respectively, which handle the execution of stateless and stateful smart contracts.

2. **Question**: How does the `execute` method work in the `VM` class and its subclasses?
   **Answer**: The `execute` method in the `VM` class takes a `ContractObj`, a method index, and a vector of arguments as input. It sets up the initial frame and executes the method with the given arguments. In the subclasses `StatelessVM` and `StatefulVM`, the `execute` method is overridden to handle the specific execution requirements for stateless and stateful smart contracts.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TxScriptExecution` case class in the `StatefulVM` object?
   **Answer**: The `TxScriptExecution` case class represents the result of executing a transaction script in a stateful virtual machine. It contains information about the remaining gas, contract inputs, contract previous outputs, and generated outputs after the script execution.
