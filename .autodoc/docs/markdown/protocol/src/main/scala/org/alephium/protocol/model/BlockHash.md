This file contains the implementation of the `BlockHash` class and its companion object. The `BlockHash` class is a wrapper around the `Blake3` hash function, which is used to compute the hash of a block in the Alephium blockchain. The `BlockHash` class is defined as a `final case class` with a private constructor, which means that instances of this class can only be created using the `apply` method defined in the companion object.

The `BlockHash` class extends the `RandomBytes` trait, which provides a `bytes` method that returns the hash value as a `ByteString`. The `BlockHash` class also provides a `value` field that holds the actual `Blake3` hash value.

The companion object provides several methods for creating and manipulating `BlockHash` instances. The `generate` method creates a new `BlockHash` instance with a randomly generated hash value. The `from` method takes a `ByteString` and returns an `Option[BlockHash]` if the `ByteString` can be parsed as a valid `Blake3` hash value. The `unsafe` methods create a new `BlockHash` instance from a `ByteString` or a `Blake3` hash value without performing any validation. The `doubleHash` method computes the double hash of a `ByteString` using the `Blake3` hash function.

The `BlockHash` companion object also provides a `serde` instance for serializing and deserializing `BlockHash` instances using the `Serde` library. The `zero` and `length` fields provide the zero value and length of the `Blake3` hash function, respectively.

Overall, this file provides a simple and efficient implementation of the `BlockHash` class and its companion object, which is used extensively throughout the Alephium blockchain to compute and manipulate block hashes. Here is an example of how to create a new `BlockHash` instance:

```scala
import akka.util.ByteString
import org.alephium.protocol.model.BlockHash

val bytes = ByteString("hello world")
val hash = BlockHash.hash(bytes)
println(hash.bytes)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockHash` class and how is it used in the `alephium` project?
   
   The `BlockHash` class represents a hash value for a block in the `alephium` project. It is used to generate, store, and compare block hashes.

2. What is the `Serde` trait and how is it used in the `BlockHash` companion object?
   
   The `Serde` trait is used for serialization and deserialization of objects in the `alephium` project. In the `BlockHash` companion object, it is used to define a serializer for the `BlockHash` class.

3. What is the purpose of the `unsafe` methods in the `BlockHash` companion object?
   
   The `unsafe` methods in the `BlockHash` companion object are used to create a `BlockHash` instance from a `ByteString` or a `Blake3` hash value without performing any validation. These methods are marked as `unsafe` because they can potentially lead to runtime errors if the input is not valid.
