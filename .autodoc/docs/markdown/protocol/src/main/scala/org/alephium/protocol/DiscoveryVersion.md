This file contains the definition of a case class called `DiscoveryVersion` and an object with the same name. The `DiscoveryVersion` case class takes an integer value as its parameter and extends `AnyVal`, which means that it is a value class and will be represented as a primitive type at runtime. The purpose of this class is to represent the version number of the discovery protocol used by the Alephium network.

The `DiscoveryVersion` object contains an implicit `Serde` instance for the `DiscoveryVersion` case class. `Serde` is a serialization/deserialization library used by the Alephium project to convert objects to and from byte arrays. The `forProduct1` method of the `Serde` object is used to create a `Serde` instance for the `DiscoveryVersion` case class. This method takes two parameters: a function to create a new instance of the case class from its serialized form, and a function to extract the value of the case class instance for serialization. In this case, the `apply` method of the `DiscoveryVersion` case class is used to create a new instance, and the `value` field is used for serialization.

The `DiscoveryVersion` object also contains a `currentDiscoveryVersion` value, which is an instance of the `DiscoveryVersion` case class representing the current version of the discovery protocol used by the Alephium network. This value is set to `CurrentDiscoveryVersion`, which is likely defined in another file in the `alephium` project.

Overall, this file provides the definition of the `DiscoveryVersion` case class and an implicit `Serde` instance for it, as well as a value representing the current version of the discovery protocol used by the Alephium network. This code may be used in other parts of the Alephium project to serialize and deserialize `DiscoveryVersion` instances, or to check the current version of the discovery protocol. For example, a network node may use this code to check the version of the discovery protocol used by other nodes and ensure compatibility.
## Questions:
