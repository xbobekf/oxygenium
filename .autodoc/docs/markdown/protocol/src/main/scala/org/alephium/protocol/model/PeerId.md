This file contains the definition of a case class called `PeerId` and an object with the same name that provides a `Serde` instance for `PeerId`. 

`PeerId` is a case class that represents the unique identifier of a peer in the Alephium network. It consists of two fields: `cliqueId`, which is an instance of `CliqueId` (another case class defined elsewhere in the project), and `brokerId`, which is an integer. 

The `PeerId` object provides a `Serde` instance for `PeerId`. `Serde` is a type class that provides serialization and deserialization methods for a given type. The `Serde` instance for `PeerId` is defined using the `forProduct2` method of the `Serde` companion object. This method takes two arguments: a function that constructs a `PeerId` instance from a tuple of its fields, and a function that extracts the fields of a `PeerId` instance and returns them as a tuple. The `apply` method of `PeerId` is used as the constructor function, and a lambda expression that returns a tuple of the `cliqueId` and `brokerId` fields is used as the extractor function. 

This code is used in the larger Alephium project to define and serialize/deserialize `PeerId` instances. For example, `PeerId` instances may be used to identify and communicate with specific peers in the network. The `Serde` instance for `PeerId` is used to convert `PeerId` instances to and from byte arrays, which can be sent over the network or stored in a database. 

Example usage:

```scala
val peerId = PeerId(CliqueId("abc"), 123)
val bytes = Serde.serialize(peerId) // serialize PeerId to byte array
val peerId2 = Serde.deserialize[PeerId](bytes) // deserialize byte array to PeerId
assert(peerId == peerId2) // check that the deserialized PeerId is equal to the original
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PeerId` case class?
   - The `PeerId` case class represents a unique identifier for a peer in the Alephium protocol, consisting of a `CliqueId` and a `brokerId`.
2. What is the `serde` object and what does it do?
   - The `serde` object provides serialization and deserialization functionality for the `PeerId` case class using the `Serde` library.
3. What license is this code released under?
   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.
