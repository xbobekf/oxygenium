The code in this file is part of the Alephium project and provides a compact integer encoding and decoding mechanism for both signed and unsigned integers. The encoding is heavily influenced by Polkadot's SCALE Codec and is designed to be space-efficient for small integers while still supporting large integers up to 2^536.

The `CompactInteger` object is divided into two sub-objects: `Unsigned` and `Signed`. Each sub-object provides methods for encoding and decoding integers in their respective formats. The encoding uses the first two most significant bits to denote the mode, which determines the number of bytes used to represent the integer. There are four modes: single-byte, two-byte, four-byte, and multi-byte.

For example, the `Unsigned` object provides methods like `encode(n: U32)` and `encode(n: U256)` for encoding unsigned integers, and methods like `decodeU32(bs: ByteString)` and `decodeU256(bs: ByteString)` for decoding them. Similarly, the `Signed` object provides methods for encoding and decoding signed integers.

The `Mode` trait and its implementations (`SingleByte`, `TwoByte`, `FourByte`, and `MultiByte`) are used to determine the encoding mode and handle the encoding and decoding process based on the mode.

Here's an example of encoding and decoding an unsigned integer:

```scala
import org.alephium.serde.CompactInteger.Unsigned
import akka.util.ByteString

val number = 42
val encoded = Unsigned.encode(number) // ByteString(0x2a)
val decoded = Unsigned.decodeU32(encoded) // Right(Staging(42, ByteString()))
```

This compact integer encoding and decoding mechanism can be used throughout the Alephium project to efficiently store and transmit integer values, especially when dealing with small integers that are common in blockchain applications.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `CompactInteger` object and its sub-objects `Unsigned` and `Signed`?
   **Answer**: The `CompactInteger` object is designed to encode and decode compact representations of integers, both signed and unsigned. The sub-objects `Unsigned` and `Signed` handle the encoding and decoding of unsigned and signed integers, respectively.

2. **Question**: How does the encoding and decoding process work for different integer sizes and ranges?
   **Answer**: The encoding and decoding process uses the first two most significant bits to denote the mode (single-byte, two-byte, four-byte, or multi-byte mode) and encodes/decodes the integer based on its size and range. Different modes are used to represent different integer ranges, allowing for a more compact representation of the integer.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Mode` trait and its implementations (`SingleByte`, `TwoByte`, `FourByte`, and `MultiByte`)?
   **Answer**: The `Mode` trait and its implementations are used to represent the different modes of encoding and decoding integers based on their size and range. Each implementation corresponds to a specific mode (single-byte, two-byte, four-byte, or multi-byte mode) and provides the necessary information (prefix and negPrefix) for encoding and decoding integers in that mode.
