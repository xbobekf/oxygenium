This code defines a case class called `GetGroup` that is used in the Oxygenium project's API model. The `GetGroup` case class takes an `Address` object as a parameter and is marked as `final`, meaning it cannot be extended or subclassed.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way for users of the Oxygenium API to retrieve information about a specific group of addresses. The `Address` object passed to the `GetGroup` case class represents the starting address of the group, and the API will return information about all addresses in the group.

This code is part of a larger project that provides a variety of API endpoints for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain. Other parts of the project likely use the `GetGroup` case class to handle requests from users and return the appropriate information.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```scala
import org.oxygenium.api.model.GetGroup
import org.oxygenium.protocol.model.Address

val address = Address.fromString("0x123456789abcdef")
val groupRequest = GetGroup(address)

// send groupRequest to Oxygenium API and receive response
// response will contain information about all addresses in the group starting at `address`
```

Overall, this code provides a simple and flexible way for users of the Oxygenium API to retrieve information about groups of addresses on the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetGroup` case class?
   - The `GetGroup` case class is used to represent a request to retrieve a group associated with a specific address in the Oxygenium protocol.
2. What is the significance of the `Address` import statement?
   - The `Address` import statement is used to import the `Address` class from the `org.oxygenium.protocol.model` package, which is likely used in the implementation of the `GetGroup` case class.
3. What is the license under which this code is distributed?
   - This code is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.
