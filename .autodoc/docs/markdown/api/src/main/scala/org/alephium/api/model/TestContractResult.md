This file contains two case classes: `TestContractResult` and `DebugMessage`. These classes are used to represent the result of testing a smart contract and debug messages respectively. 

The `TestContractResult` case class has several fields that represent the result of testing a smart contract. The `address` field is of type `Address.Contract` and represents the address of the smart contract being tested. The `codeHash` field is of type `Hash` and represents the hash of the smart contract's code. The `returns` field is of type `AVector[Val]` and represents the values returned by the smart contract. The `gasUsed` field is of type `Int` and represents the amount of gas used during the execution of the smart contract. The `contracts` field is of type `AVector[ContractState]` and represents the state of any contracts created during the execution of the smart contract. The `txInputs` field is of type `AVector[Address]` and represents the addresses of the inputs to the transaction that executed the smart contract. The `txOutputs` field is of type `AVector[Output]` and represents the outputs of the transaction that executed the smart contract. The `events` field is of type `AVector[ContractEventByTxId]` and represents the events emitted by the smart contract during its execution. 

The `DebugMessage` case class has two fields: `contractAddress` of type `Address.Contract` and `message` of type `String`. This class is used to represent debug messages that can be printed during the execution of a smart contract. The `toString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the debug message that includes the contract address and the message itself. 

These case classes are used in the larger Alephium project to facilitate the testing and debugging of smart contracts. The `TestContractResult` case class is used to represent the result of testing a smart contract, which can be used to verify that the smart contract is functioning as expected. The `DebugMessage` case class is used to provide developers with a way to print debug messages during the execution of a smart contract, which can be useful for identifying and fixing bugs. 

Example usage of `TestContractResult`:
```
val result = TestContractResult(
  address = Address.Contract("0x1234"),
  codeHash = Hash("abcd"),
  returns = AVector(Val.IntValue(42)),
  gasUsed = 1000,
  contracts = AVector.empty,
  txInputs = AVector(Address("0x5678")),
  txOutputs = AVector(Output(Address("0x1234"), Val.IntValue(42))),
  events = AVector.empty,
  debugMessages = AVector.empty
)
```

Example usage of `DebugMessage`:
```
val debugMessage = DebugMessage(Address.Contract("0x1234"), "Something went wrong")
println(debugMessage.toString()) // prints "DEBUG - 0x1234 - Something went wrong"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TestContractResult` case class?
   - The `TestContractResult` case class represents the result of executing a test contract and contains information such as the contract address, code hash, gas used, and more.
2. What is the `DebugMessage` case class used for?
   - The `DebugMessage` case class represents a debug message associated with a contract address and is used to provide additional information during testing and debugging.
3. What are the dependencies of this file?
   - This file depends on several other classes and packages, including `Hash` and `Address` from the `org.alephium.protocol` package, `AVector` from the `org.alephium.util` package, and `ContractState`, `Address`, and `Output` from unspecified packages.
