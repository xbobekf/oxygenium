The `BuildExecuteScriptTx` class is a model used in the Alephium project to represent a transaction that executes a smart contract script. It contains various parameters that are used to build the transaction, including the public key of the sender (`fromPublicKey`), the bytecode of the script (`bytecode`), the amount of Alph tokens to transfer (`attoAlphAmount`), any additional tokens to transfer (`tokens`), the amount of gas to use (`gasAmount`), the price of gas (`gasPrice`), and the target block hash (`targetBlockHash`).

This class is used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the project to build and execute transactions on the Alephium blockchain. For example, a developer could use this class to build a transaction that executes a custom smart contract on the blockchain, transferring tokens and interacting with other contracts as needed.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in code:

```
val tx = BuildExecuteScriptTx(
  fromPublicKey = ByteString("mypublickey"),
  bytecode = ByteString("myscriptbytecode"),
  attoAlphAmount = Some(Amount(100000000000000L)),
  tokens = Some(AVector(Token("mytoken", 1000L))),
  gasAmount = Some(GasBox(100000L)),
  gasPrice = Some(GasPrice(100L)),
  targetBlockHash = Some(BlockHash("mytargetblockhash"))
)

// Send the transaction to the network
val result = sendTransaction(tx)
```

In this example, a new `BuildExecuteScriptTx` object is created with the necessary parameters to execute a custom smart contract. The transaction is then sent to the network using the `sendTransaction` method (not shown).
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BuildExecuteScriptTx` class?
- The `BuildExecuteScriptTx` class is used to build and execute a transaction that contains a script bytecode.

2. What are the optional parameters that can be passed to the `BuildExecuteScriptTx` constructor?
- The optional parameters that can be passed to the `BuildExecuteScriptTx` constructor are `fromPublicKeyType`, `attoAlphAmount`, `tokens`, `gasAmount`, `gasPrice`, and `targetBlockHash`.

3. What other classes or packages are imported in this file?
- This file imports classes from `akka.util.ByteString`, `org.alephium.protocol.model.BlockHash`, `org.alephium.protocol.vm.{GasBox, GasPrice}`, and `org.alephium.util.AVector`.
