This file contains a Scala case class called `CounterRange` and a companion object with a custom `Validator` for validating instances of the case class. 

The `CounterRange` case class has two fields: `start` and `limitOpt`. `start` is an integer representing the starting value of a counter, while `limitOpt` is an optional integer representing the maximum value of the counter. 

The companion object contains a `MaxCounterRange` constant, which is set to 100. This constant is used in the custom `Validator` to ensure that the `limitOpt` field is not larger than this value. 

The `validator` field is a custom `Validator` for validating instances of the `CounterRange` case class. It checks that the `start` field is not negative, and if `limitOpt` is present, it checks that it is larger than 0 and not larger than `MaxCounterRange`. If `limitOpt` is not present, it checks that `start` is smaller than `Int.MaxValue - MaxCounterRange`. 

This code is likely used in the larger Alephium project to validate user input related to counters, such as when querying a database for a range of values. The `CounterRange` case class provides a convenient way to represent a range of counter values, while the custom `Validator` ensures that the input is valid and within acceptable limits. 

Example usage:

```scala
val validRange = CounterRange(0, Some(50))
val invalidRange = CounterRange(-1, Some(200))

val validResult = CounterRange.validator.validate(validRange)
// validResult: ValidationResult.Valid.type = Valid

val invalidResult = CounterRange.validator.validate(invalidRange)
// invalidResult: ValidationResult.Invalid = Invalid(`start` must not be negative)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CounterRange` class?
   - The `CounterRange` class represents a range of counters with a starting value and an optional limit.
2. What is the maximum value for the `limit` parameter in `CounterRange`?
   - The maximum value for the `limit` parameter is 100, as defined by the `MaxCounterRange` constant.
3. What is the purpose of the `validator` in the `CounterRange` object?
   - The `validator` is used to validate instances of the `CounterRange` class, ensuring that the `start` and `limit` parameters are within certain bounds.
