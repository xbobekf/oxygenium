This code defines a case class called `HashesAtHeight` which contains a vector of `BlockHash` objects. The purpose of this class is to represent a collection of block hashes at a specific height in the Alephium blockchain. 

The `BlockHash` class is imported from the `org.alephium.protocol.model` package, which suggests that this code is part of the Alephium blockchain protocol implementation. The `AVector` class is imported from the `org.alephium.util` package, which is likely a utility package for the Alephium project.

This class can be used in the larger project to represent a snapshot of the blockchain at a specific height. For example, it could be used in the implementation of a blockchain explorer to display a list of block hashes at a certain height. 

Here is an example of how this class could be used:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model.HashesAtHeight
import org.alephium.protocol.model.BlockHash
import org.alephium.util.AVector

val blockHashes: AVector[BlockHash] = AVector(
  BlockHash("0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"),
  BlockHash("1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"),
  BlockHash("2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222")
)

val hashesAtHeight = HashesAtHeight(blockHashes)

println(hashesAtHeight.headers) // prints: AVector(BlockHash(0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000), BlockHash(1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111), BlockHash(2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222))
```

In this example, we create a vector of `BlockHash` objects and pass it to the `HashesAtHeight` constructor to create a new `HashesAtHeight` object. We then print out the `headers` field of the object, which contains the vector of block hashes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HashesAtHeight` case class?
   - The `HashesAtHeight` case class is used to represent a list of block hashes at a specific height in the Alephium blockchain.

2. What is the significance of importing `org.alephium.protocol.model.BlockHash` and `org.alephium.util.AVector`?
   - The `org.alephium.protocol.model.BlockHash` import is used to reference the `BlockHash` type, which is used in the `HashesAtHeight` case class. The `org.alephium.util.AVector` import is used to reference the `AVector` type, which is used to store the list of block hashes in the `HashesAtHeight` case class.

3. What license is this code released under?
   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.
