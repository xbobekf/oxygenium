This file contains a trait called "Examples" that provides several methods for generating examples of endpoint input and output data. This trait is part of the alephium project and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The "Examples" trait has four methods: "simpleExample", "defaultExample", "moreSettingsExample", and "moreSettingsExample" with a summary parameter. These methods take a generic type "T" as input and return an example of type "Example[T]". 

The "simpleExample" method returns a list containing a single example of the input or output data with no additional information. The "defaultExample" method returns a single example with a label of "Default". The "moreSettingsExample" method returns a single example with a label of "More settings". The "moreSettingsExample" method with a summary parameter returns a single example with a custom label specified by the summary parameter.

These methods can be used to generate examples of input and output data for endpoints in the alephium project. These examples can be used for testing and documentation purposes. For example, a developer could use the "simpleExample" method to generate an example of a user's account information to test the endpoint that retrieves this information. The resulting example could also be included in the endpoint's documentation to provide an example of the expected input and output data.
