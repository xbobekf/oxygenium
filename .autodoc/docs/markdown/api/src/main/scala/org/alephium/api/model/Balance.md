The `Balance` class and its companion object are part of the Alephium project and are used to represent the balance of an account. The `Balance` class is a case class that takes in several parameters, including the account's balance, locked balance, token balances, locked token balances, and the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) associated with the account. The `Balance` object provides two methods for creating a `Balance` instance from different input types.

The first method, `from`, takes in the account's balance, locked balance, token balances, locked token balances, the number of UTXOs, and an optional warning message. This method is used to create a `Balance` instance from the account's current state.

The second method, also named `from`, takes in a tuple containing the account's balance, locked balance, token balances, locked token balances, and the number of UTXOs, as well as a limit on the number of UTXOs to include in the balance calculation. This method is used to create a `Balance` instance from the output of a balance calculation function.

The `getTokenBalances` method is a private helper method that takes in a vector of token balances and returns an optional vector of `Token` instances. Each `Token` instance represents a token balance associated with the account.

Overall, the `Balance` class and its companion object are used to represent the balance of an account in the Alephium project. The `Balance` class provides a convenient way to store and manipulate balance information, while the `Balance` object provides methods for creating `Balance` instances from different input types.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Balance` class and what does it represent?
- The `Balance` class represents the balance of an account, including the amount of tokens and locked tokens, as well as the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) associated with the account.

2. What is the difference between `tokenBalances` and `lockedTokenBalances`?
- `tokenBalances` represents the balances of regular tokens, while `lockedTokenBalances` represents the balances of tokens that are currently locked and cannot be spent.

3. What is the purpose of the `from` methods in the `Balance` object?
- The `from` methods are used to create a `Balance` instance from various input parameters, such as token balances and UTXO information. They provide a convenient way to construct a `Balance` object with the necessary fields initialized.
