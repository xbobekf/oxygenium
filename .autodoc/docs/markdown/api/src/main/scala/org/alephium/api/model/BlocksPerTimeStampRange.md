[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/api/src/main/scala/org/alephium/api/model/BlocksPerTimeStampRange.scala)

This code defines a case class called `BlocksPerTimeStampRange` that is used to represent a collection of blocks grouped by timestamp ranges. The `blocks` field is an `AVector` of `AVector` of `BlockEntry` objects, where each inner `AVector` represents a range of timestamps and contains the corresponding `BlockEntry` objects.

This case class is likely used in the larger Alephium project to organize and manage blocks in the blockchain. By grouping blocks by timestamp ranges, it may be easier to analyze and process blocks within a certain time frame. For example, this data structure could be used to calculate the average block time for a certain range of blocks.

Here is an example of how this case class could be used:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model.BlocksPerTimeStampRange
import org.alephium.util.AVector

// Create some sample block entries
val block1 = BlockEntry(...)
val block2 = BlockEntry(...)
val block3 = BlockEntry(...)

// Group the blocks by timestamp ranges
val blocksByTime = BlocksPerTimeStampRange(AVector(
  AVector(block1, block2),
  AVector(block3)
))

// Access the blocks within a certain timestamp range
val blocksInRange = blocksByTime.blocks(0) // returns AVector(block1, block2)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlocksPerTimeStampRange` case class?
   - The `BlocksPerTimeStampRange` case class is used to represent a collection of blocks grouped by timestamp range.

2. What is the `BlockEntry` type and where is it defined?
   - The code does not provide information on the `BlockEntry` type or where it is defined. A smart developer might need to search for its definition in other parts of the project.

3. What is the significance of the `AVector` type used in this code?
   - The `AVector` type is likely a custom implementation of a vector data structure used in the Alephium project. A smart developer might need to investigate its implementation and usage in the project to understand its significance in this code.
