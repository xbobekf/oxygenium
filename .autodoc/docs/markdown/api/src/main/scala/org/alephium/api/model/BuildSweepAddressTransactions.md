The code defines a case class called `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` which is used to build transactions for sweeping assets from one address to another. The class takes in several parameters including the public key of the sender, the address of the receiver, the maximum amount of assets that can be transferred per UTXO (unspent transaction output), the lock time for the transaction, the gas amount and gas price for the transaction, and the target block hash.

This class is part of the `org.alephium.api.model` package and is used in the Alephium project to facilitate the transfer of assets between addresses. The `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` class is used to create a transaction that transfers assets from one address to another in a single transaction. This is useful when a user wants to consolidate their assets into a single address or when they want to transfer assets to a new address.

Here is an example of how the `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` class can be used:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model.BuildSweepAddressTransactions
import org.alephium.protocol.PublicKey
import org.alephium.protocol.model.{Address, BlockHash}
import org.alephium.protocol.vm.{GasBox, GasPrice}
import org.alephium.util.TimeStamp

val fromPublicKey = PublicKey("...")
val toAddress = Address.Asset("...")
val maxAttoAlphPerUTXO = Some(100000000000L)
val lockTime = Some(TimeStamp.now())
val gasAmount = Some(GasBox(100000L))
val gasPrice = Some(GasPrice(100L))
val targetBlockHash = Some(BlockHash("..."))

val tx = BuildSweepAddressTransactions(
  fromPublicKey,
  toAddress,
  maxAttoAlphPerUTXO,
  lockTime,
  gasAmount,
  gasPrice,
  targetBlockHash
)
```

In this example, a new `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` object is created with the specified parameters. This object can then be used to create a transaction that transfers assets from the `fromPublicKey` address to the `toAddress` address. The `maxAttoAlphPerUTXO`, `lockTime`, `gasAmount`, `gasPrice`, and `targetBlockHash` parameters are optional and can be omitted if not needed.

Overall, the `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` class is an important part of the Alephium project as it allows users to easily transfer assets between addresses in a single transaction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` case class?
- The `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` case class is used to build transactions that sweep all UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) of a given asset from a specific address to another address.

2. What are the optional parameters of the `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` case class?
- The optional parameters of the `BuildSweepAddressTransactions` case class are `maxAttoAlphPerUTXO`, `lockTime`, `gasAmount`, `gasPrice`, and `targetBlockHash`. These parameters allow for customization of the transaction, such as setting a maximum amount of asset per UTXO, specifying a lock time, setting gas limits and prices, and targeting a specific block hash.

3. What is the purpose of the `BuildTxCommon` trait?
- The `BuildTxCommon` trait is a common trait for building transactions that provides common functionality and fields that are shared across different types of transactions.
