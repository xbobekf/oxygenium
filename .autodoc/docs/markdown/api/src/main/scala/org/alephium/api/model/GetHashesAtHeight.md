This code defines a case class called `GetHashesAtHeight` that is used in the Alephium project's API model. The purpose of this case class is to represent a request to retrieve the block hashes at a specific height range for a particular chain. 

The case class takes three parameters: `fromGroup`, `toGroup`, and `height`. `fromGroup` and `toGroup` represent the range of block groups to search for the requested height, while `height` represents the specific height to retrieve the block hashes for. 

This case class is marked as `final`, meaning it cannot be extended or subclassed. It also extends the `PerChain` trait, which is used to indicate that this request is specific to a single chain. 

This case class can be used in conjunction with other API model classes and methods to retrieve block hashes for a specific height range on a particular chain. For example, a method in the API model may take a `GetHashesAtHeight` object as a parameter and return a list of block hashes that match the specified height range and chain. 

Example usage:

```
val request = GetHashesAtHeight(fromGroup = 0, toGroup = 10, height = 100)
val blockHashes = apiModel.getBlockHashes(request)
``` 

In this example, a `GetHashesAtHeight` object is created with a `fromGroup` value of 0, a `toGroup` value of 10, and a `height` value of 100. This object is then passed as a parameter to the `getBlockHashes` method in the API model, which returns a list of block hashes that match the specified height range and chain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetHashesAtHeight` case class?
   - The `GetHashesAtHeight` case class is used to represent a request to retrieve block hashes within a certain height range for a specific chain.

2. What is the significance of the `PerChain` trait that `GetHashesAtHeight` extends?
   - The `PerChain` trait is likely a marker trait that indicates that the `GetHashesAtHeight` request is specific to a particular chain within the Alephium project.

3. Are there any other files or dependencies required to use this code?
   - It is unclear from this code snippet whether there are any other files or dependencies required to use this code. Additional context or documentation may be necessary to determine this.
