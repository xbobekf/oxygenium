This file contains code that defines a set of classes and traits related to transaction status in the Alephium project. The code is written in Scala and is part of the Alephium API model.

The main purpose of this code is to define the different states that a transaction can be in within the Alephium network. The `TxStatus` trait is a sealed trait, which means that all of its implementations must be defined in the same file. The three implementations of `TxStatus` defined in this file are `Confirmed`, `MemPooled`, and `TxNotFound`.

`Confirmed` represents a transaction that has been confirmed and included in a block. It contains information about the block hash, transaction index, and various confirmation counts. `MemPooled` represents a transaction that is currently in the mempool, waiting to be included in a block. `TxNotFound` represents a transaction that could not be found in the network.

These classes are used throughout the Alephium project to represent the status of transactions. For example, when querying the status of a transaction through the Alephium API, the response will include a `TxStatus` object that indicates whether the transaction is confirmed, in the mempool, or not found.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model._

val txStatus: TxStatus = // some code that retrieves the status of a transaction

txStatus match {
  case Confirmed(blockHash, txIndex, _, _, _) =>
    println(s"Transaction confirmed in block $blockHash at index $txIndex")
  case MemPooled() =>
    println("Transaction is in the mempool")
  case TxNotFound() =>
    println("Transaction not found")
}
```

In this example, we retrieve the status of a transaction and pattern match on the result to determine what state the transaction is in. Depending on the state, we print out a different message to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a sealed trait and three case classes related to transaction status in the Alephium project.

2. What is the significance of the `@upickle.implicits.key` annotation?
- The `@upickle.implicits.key` annotation is used to specify the key name for a case class when it is serialized/deserialized using the upickle library.

3. What is the `BlockHash` type and where is it defined?
- The `BlockHash` type is used as a parameter in the `Confirmed` case class and is likely defined in another file within the Alephium project.
