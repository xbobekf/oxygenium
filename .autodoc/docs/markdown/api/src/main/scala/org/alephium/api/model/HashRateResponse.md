The code defines a case class called `HashRateResponse` which is used to represent the response of a hash rate API endpoint in the Alephium project. The `final` keyword indicates that the class cannot be extended or overridden. The class has a single field called `hashrate` which is of type `String`. The `AnyVal` keyword indicates that the class is a value class, which means that it has a single field and no other non-private fields or methods.

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized response format for the hash rate API endpoint. The `HashRateResponse` class is used to encapsulate the hash rate value returned by the endpoint and provide a consistent structure for the response. This allows other parts of the project to easily consume the response and extract the hash rate value without having to parse the response format themselves.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model.HashRateResponse

val responseJson = """{"hashrate": "10 TH/s"}"""
val response = HashRateResponse(responseJson)

println(response.hashrate) // prints "10 TH/s"
```

In this example, the `responseJson` variable contains a JSON string representing the response from the hash rate API endpoint. The `HashRateResponse` constructor is used to parse the JSON string and create a new `HashRateResponse` instance. The `response.hashrate` field is then accessed to extract the hash rate value from the response. This value can then be used by other parts of the project as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HashRateResponse` case class?
   - The `HashRateResponse` case class is used to represent a response containing a hashrate value in the `org.alephium.api.model` package.

2. What is the expected format of the `hashrate` field in the `HashRateResponse` case class?
   - The `hashrate` field in the `HashRateResponse` case class is expected to be a string.

3. What license is this code released under?
   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.
