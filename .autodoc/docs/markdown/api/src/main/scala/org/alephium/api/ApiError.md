This file contains code for handling API errors in the Alephium project. The code defines a sealed trait called `ApiError` that represents an error that can occur in the API. The trait has a single method `detail` that returns a string describing the error. The file also defines several case classes that extend the `ApiError` trait and represent specific types of errors that can occur in the API. These case classes include `Unauthorized`, `BadRequest`, `ServiceUnavailable`, `InternalServerError`, and `NotFound`.

Each case class has a `detail` field that provides a string description of the error. The `NotFound` case class also has a `resource` field that specifies the resource that was not found. The case classes also define a companion object that extends the `Companion` trait. The companion object provides methods for creating and reading instances of the case class, as well as defining a schema for the error.

The file also imports several classes from the `sttp` and `tapir` libraries that are used to define the schema for the errors. The `Schema` class is used to define the schema for the errors, and the `SProduct` and `SProductField` classes are used to define the fields of the schema.

Overall, this code provides a way to handle errors that can occur in the Alephium API. The `ApiError` trait provides a common interface for all errors, while the case classes provide specific implementations for different types of errors. The companion objects provide methods for creating and reading instances of the case classes, and the schema definitions provide a way to serialize and deserialize the errors. This code is an important part of the Alephium project, as it ensures that errors are handled consistently and effectively throughout the API. 

Example usage:

```scala
val error = ApiError.NotFound("Resource not found")
println(error.detail) // prints "Resource not found"
```
