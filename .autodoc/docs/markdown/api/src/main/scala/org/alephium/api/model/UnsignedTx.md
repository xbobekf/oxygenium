The `UnsignedTx` class and its companion object are part of the Alephium project and are used to represent unsigned transactions. Transactions are the fundamental building blocks of the Alephium blockchain, and they are used to transfer assets between accounts. 

The `UnsignedTx` class has several fields that represent the transaction's properties, such as its ID, version, network ID, script, gas amount, gas price, inputs, and fixed outputs. The `toProtocol` method is used to convert an instance of `UnsignedTx` to an instance of `UnsignedTransaction`, which is a protocol-level representation of a transaction. The `fromProtocol` method is used to convert an instance of `UnsignedTransaction` to an instance of `UnsignedTx`.

The `UnsignedTx` class is used in the larger Alephium project to represent unsigned transactions that are created by users or other parts of the system. These transactions are then signed and broadcast to the network to be included in a block. The `UnsignedTx` class is also used to deserialize transactions received from the network, which are then validated and processed by the system.

Here is an example of how to create an instance of `UnsignedTx`:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model._

val txId = TransactionId(Array[Byte](1, 2, 3))
val version = 1.toByte
val networkId = 1.toByte
val gasAmount = 1000
val gasPrice = U256(1000000000L)
val inputs = AVector(AssetInput.empty)
val fixedOutputs = AVector(FixedAssetOutput.empty)

val unsignedTx = UnsignedTx(txId, version, networkId, None, gasAmount, gasPrice, inputs, fixedOutputs)
```

This creates an instance of `UnsignedTx` with the specified properties. The `toProtocol` method can then be called on this instance to convert it to an instance of `UnsignedTransaction`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UnsignedTx` class?
- The `UnsignedTx` class represents an unsigned transaction in the Alephium protocol, with various properties such as inputs, outputs, and gas price.

2. What is the `toProtocol` method used for?
- The `toProtocol` method is used to convert an `UnsignedTx` instance to an `UnsignedTransaction` instance, which is a protocol-level representation of an unsigned transaction.

3. What is the `fromProtocol` method used for?
- The `fromProtocol` method is used to convert an `UnsignedTransaction` instance to an `UnsignedTx` instance, which is a model-level representation of an unsigned transaction used by the API.
