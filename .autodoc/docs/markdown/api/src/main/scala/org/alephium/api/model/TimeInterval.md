This file contains the definition of a case class called `TimeInterval` and an object with the same name. The `TimeInterval` case class represents a time interval between two timestamps, `from` and `toOpt`. The `from` timestamp is mandatory, while the `toOpt` timestamp is optional. If `toOpt` is not provided, the current timestamp is used as the `to` timestamp. 

The `TimeInterval` case class has two methods. The first method, `validateTimeSpan`, takes a `max` duration as input and returns an `Either` type. If the duration of the time interval is greater than the `max` duration, it returns a `Left` type with a `BadRequest` error message. Otherwise, it returns a `Right` type with a unit value. The second method, `durationUnsafe`, calculates the duration of the time interval between `from` and `to` timestamps.

The `TimeInterval` object has a `validator` method that returns a `Validator` type. The `Validator` type is used to validate the `TimeInterval` case class. The `validator` method checks if the `from` timestamp is before the `to` timestamp. If the `from` timestamp is greater than or equal to the `to` timestamp, it returns an `Invalid` type with an error message. Otherwise, it returns a `Valid` type.

This code can be used in the larger project to represent time intervals between two timestamps. It can be used to validate time intervals and calculate their duration. The `validator` method can be used to validate the `TimeInterval` case class before using it in other parts of the project. Here is an example of how to use the `TimeInterval` case class:

```
import org.alephium.api.model.TimeInterval
import org.alephium.util.TimeStamp

val from = TimeStamp.now()
val to = from.plusMinutes(30)
val timeInterval = TimeInterval(from, Some(to))
val duration = timeInterval.durationUnsafe()
val validationResult = TimeInterval.validator(timeInterval)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TimeInterval` class?
   - The `TimeInterval` class represents a time interval between two `TimeStamp` instances and provides methods for validating the time span and calculating the duration.
2. What is the `validator` property in the `TimeInterval` object used for?
   - The `validator` property is a `Validator` instance that checks if the `from` timestamp is before the `to` timestamp and returns a validation result accordingly.
3. What license is this code released under?
   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.
