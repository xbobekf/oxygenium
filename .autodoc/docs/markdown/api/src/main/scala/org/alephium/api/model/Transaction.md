The code defines a `Transaction` class and a companion object in the `org.alephium.api.model` package. The `Transaction` class represents a transaction in the Alephium blockchain. It contains the following fields:

- `unsigned`: an `UnsignedTx` object representing the unsigned part of the transaction.
- `scriptExecutionOk`: a boolean indicating whether the script execution was successful.
- `contractInputs`: a vector of `OutputRef` objects representing the inputs to the transaction that are contract outputs.
- `generatedOutputs`: a vector of `Output` objects representing the outputs generated by the transaction.
- `inputSignatures`: a vector of `ByteString` objects representing the signatures of the inputs to the transaction.
- `scriptSignatures`: a vector of `ByteString` objects representing the signatures of the script execution.

The `Transaction` class has a method `toProtocol()` that converts the transaction to a `protocol.Transaction` object. The `protocol.Transaction` object is defined in the `org.alephium.protocol.model` package. The `toProtocol()` method uses the `UnsignedTx` object to create the `unsignedTx` field of the `protocol.Transaction` object. It also converts the `inputSignatures` and `scriptSignatures` fields to `Signature` objects using the `deserialize` method from the `org.alephium.serde` package. The `contractInputs` field is converted to `ContractOutputRef` objects using the `unsafeToContractOutputRef()` method. Finally, the `generatedOutputs` field is converted to `protocol.Output` objects using the `toProtocol()` method.

The companion object of the `Transaction` class has a method `fromProtocol()` that converts a `protocol.Transaction` object to a `Transaction` object. It uses the `UnsignedTx.fromProtocol()` method to create the `unsigned` field of the `Transaction` object. It also converts the `contractInputs` field to `OutputRef` objects using the `OutputRef.from()` method. The `generatedOutputs` field is converted to `Output` objects using the `Output.from()` method. The `inputSignatures` and `scriptSignatures` fields are serialized to `ByteString` objects using the `serialize` method from the `org.alephium.serde` package.

Overall, this code provides a way to convert transactions between the Alephium blockchain and the API layer. It allows the API layer to create and manipulate transactions, and to communicate with the blockchain layer.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Transaction` class?
   - The `Transaction` class represents a transaction in the Alephium protocol, containing information such as unsigned transaction data, input and script signatures, and generated outputs.
2. What is the `toProtocol` method used for?
   - The `toProtocol` method is used to convert a `Transaction` object to a `protocol.Transaction` object, which is a serialized version of the transaction that can be sent over the network.
3. What is the `fromProtocol` method used for?
   - The `fromProtocol` method is used to convert a `protocol.Transaction` object to a `Transaction` object, which is a deserialized version of the transaction that can be used within the Alephium codebase.
