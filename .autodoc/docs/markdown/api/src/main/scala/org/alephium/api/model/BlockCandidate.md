The code defines a case class called `BlockCandidate` which is used to represent a candidate block in the Alephium project. 

The `BlockCandidate` class has five fields:
- `fromGroup`: an integer representing the group from which the block is being proposed
- `toGroup`: an integer representing the group to which the block is being proposed
- `headerBlob`: a `ByteString` object representing the header of the block
- `target`: a `BigInteger` object representing the target difficulty of the block
- `txsBlob`: a `ByteString` object representing the transactions included in the block

This class is likely used in the larger project to represent a potential block that can be added to the Alephium blockchain. The `fromGroup` and `toGroup` fields indicate the groups involved in the block proposal, while the `headerBlob` and `txsBlob` fields contain the necessary data for the block header and transactions respectively. The `target` field represents the difficulty target for the block, which is used to ensure that the block is valid and meets the necessary requirements for inclusion in the blockchain.

An example usage of this class could be in the process of mining a new block. Miners would use the `BlockCandidate` class to represent a potential block that they are trying to mine. They would generate a header and transaction blob, calculate the target difficulty, and then create a new `BlockCandidate` object with these values. This object would then be submitted to the network for validation and potential inclusion in the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockCandidate` class?
   - The `BlockCandidate` class represents a candidate block that can be added to the Alephium blockchain, and contains information such as the sender and receiver group, block header and transaction data.

2. What is the significance of the `target` field in the `BlockCandidate` class?
   - The `target` field represents the difficulty target for the candidate block, which is used to ensure that the block is valid and meets the required level of computational effort.

3. What is the relationship between the `BlockCandidate` class and the rest of the `alephium` project?
   - The `BlockCandidate` class is part of the `org.alephium.api.model` package, which suggests that it is used in the API layer of the Alephium project. However, without further context it is unclear how exactly it is used within the project.
