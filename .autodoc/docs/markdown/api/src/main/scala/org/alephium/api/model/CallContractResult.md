This file contains two case classes, `CallContractResult` and `MultipleCallContractResult`, which are used to represent the results of calling a smart contract in the Alephium project. 

`CallContractResult` contains several fields that provide information about the execution of the contract. The `returns` field is an `AVector` (Alephium Vector) of `Val` objects, which represent the values returned by the contract. The `gasUsed` field is an integer that represents the amount of gas used during the execution of the contract. The `contracts` field is an `AVector` of `ContractState` objects, which represent the state of any contracts that were created or modified during the execution of the contract. The `txInputs` field is an `AVector` of `Address` objects, which represent the addresses that were used as inputs to the transaction that called the contract. The `txOutputs` field is an `AVector` of `Output` objects, which represent the outputs of the transaction that called the contract. Finally, the `events` field is an `AVector` of `ContractEventByTxId` objects, which represent any events emitted by the contract during its execution.

`MultipleCallContractResult` is a case class that contains a single field, `results`, which is an `AVector` of `CallContractResult` objects. This class is used to represent the results of calling multiple contracts in a single transaction.

These case classes are used throughout the Alephium project to represent the results of calling smart contracts. For example, they may be used by the API layer to return information about contract execution to clients. Here is an example of how `CallContractResult` might be used in the context of a hypothetical API endpoint:

```scala
def callContract(contractAddress: Address, inputs: AVector[Val]): CallContractResult = {
  // execute the contract and collect the necessary information
  val returns = ...
  val gasUsed = ...
  val contracts = ...
  val txInputs = ...
  val txOutputs = ...
  val events = ...

  // create a CallContractResult object and return it
  CallContractResult(returns, gasUsed, contracts, txInputs, txOutputs, events)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CallContractResult` and `MultipleCallContractResult` case classes?
- The `CallContractResult` case class represents the result of a contract call, including the return values, gas used, contract state, transaction inputs and outputs, and contract events. The `MultipleCallContractResult` case class represents the results of multiple contract calls.

2. What is the significance of the `Address`, `Output`, and `ContractEventByTxId` types imported from other packages?
- The `Address` type is likely used to represent the addresses of the transaction inputs. The `Output` type is likely used to represent the transaction outputs. The `ContractEventByTxId` type is likely used to represent events emitted by the contract during execution.

3. What is the purpose of the `AVector` type used in the case classes?
- The `AVector` type is likely a custom implementation of a vector data structure used to store the various results and data associated with contract calls. It may have specific performance or memory usage benefits over other vector implementations.
