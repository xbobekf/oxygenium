This code defines a set of Tapir codecs for various data types used in the Alephium project's API. Tapir is a library for building HTTP APIs in Scala, and codecs are used to convert between HTTP request/response data and Scala data types.

The code defines codecs for several Alephium-specific data types, including Hash, BlockHash, TransactionId, Address, ApiKey, PublicKey, U256, GasBox, GasPrice, MinerAction, and TimeSpan. These data types are used throughout the Alephium project to represent various aspects of the blockchain and its transactions.

The codecs are defined using the Tapir library's Codec type, which allows for bidirectional conversion between HTTP request/response data and Scala data types. Each codec is defined as an implicit value, which allows them to be automatically used by other parts of the Alephium API codebase.

For example, the `hashTapirCodec` codec can be used to convert a string representation of a hash to a Hash object, and vice versa. This codec can be used in Tapir endpoints to define request/response parameters that expect or return Hash objects.

Overall, this code is an important part of the Alephium API, as it defines the data types and codecs used to communicate with the blockchain and its transactions. By defining these codecs in a single location, the codebase is more maintainable and consistent, and it is easier to ensure that all parts of the API are using the same data types and formats.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains Tapir codecs for various data types used in the Alephium API.

2. What licensing terms apply to this code?
- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.

3. What is the purpose of the `fromJson` method defined in this code?
- The `fromJson` method is a generic method that creates a Tapir codec for a given data type by parsing JSON strings. It is used to define codecs for various Alephium data types.
