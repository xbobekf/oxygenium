The code in this file is part of the Alephium project and provides functionality for generating OpenAPI documentation from the Alephium API. OpenAPI is a widely used standard for describing RESTful APIs, which allows developers to understand and interact with the API more easily.

The main function in this file is `openApiJson`, which takes an `OpenAPI` object and a `dropAuth` boolean flag as input. It generates a JSON string representing the OpenAPI documentation. If `dropAuth` is set to true, the security fields in the OpenAPI object are removed before generating the JSON string.

The file also provides several utility functions for working with OpenAPI objects, such as `dropSecurityFields` for removing security fields from an OpenAPI object, `cleanOpenAPIResult` for cleaning up the generated JSON string, and `mapOperation` for mapping an operation on a `PathItem`.

Additionally, the file defines a number of implicit `Writer` instances for various OpenAPI-related classes, such as `Schema`, `Parameter`, `Response`, and `Operation`. These `Writer` instances are used to convert the corresponding objects into JSON format.

Here's an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.OpenAPIWriters._

// Assume we have an OpenAPI object representing the Alephium API
val openAPI: OpenAPI = ...

// Generate the OpenAPI JSON documentation without security fields
val openApiJsonString: String = openApiJson(openAPI, dropAuth = true)
```

This code would generate a JSON string representing the OpenAPI documentation for the Alephium API, with the security fields removed.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `openApiJson` function and what does the `dropAuth` parameter do?

   **Answer:** The `openApiJson` function takes an `OpenAPI` object and converts it into a JSON string. The `dropAuth` parameter is a boolean flag that, when set to true, removes the security fields from the OpenAPI object before converting it to JSON.

2. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `cleanOpenAPIResult` function?

   **Answer:** The `cleanOpenAPIResult` function takes an OpenAPI JSON string and replaces all occurrences of the `address.toBase58` with a modified version that has the last two characters removed. This is likely done to clean up the addresses in the OpenAPI documentation.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `expandExtensions` function?

   **Answer:** The `expandExtensions` function is a helper function that takes a `Writer[T]` and returns a new `Writer[T]` that handles the serialization of extensions in the OpenAPI objects. It ensures that the extensions are properly serialized and included in the resulting JSON object.
