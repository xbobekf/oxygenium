The code above defines a case class called `ExportFile` that is used in the Oxygenium project. The purpose of this class is to represent a file that is being exported from the project. It has a single field called `filename` which is a string that represents the name of the file being exported.

This class is likely used in other parts of the project where files need to be exported, such as when exporting data or logs. It provides a simple and standardized way to represent exported files throughout the project.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val fileToExport = ExportFile("data.csv")
exportData(fileToExport)
```

In this example, we create an instance of `ExportFile` with the filename "data.csv". We then pass this instance to a function called `exportData` which exports the data to a file with the specified name.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the Oxygenium project, providing a standardized way to represent exported files.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ExportFile` case class?
   - The `ExportFile` case class is used to represent a file that is being exported, and it contains a `filename` field that specifies the name of the file.
2. What is the significance of the GNU Lesser General Public License mentioned in the code?
   - The GNU Lesser General Public License is the license under which the `oxygenium` library is distributed, and it allows users to modify and redistribute the library under certain conditions.
3. What is the `org.oxygenium.api.model` package used for?
   - The `org.oxygenium.api.model` package contains the `ExportFile` case class and potentially other model classes that are used in the `oxygenium` API.
