This file contains a case class called InterCliquePeerInfo, which is used to represent information about a peer node in the Alephium network. The class has six fields: cliqueId, brokerId, groupNumPerBroker, address, isSynced, and clientVersion.

The cliqueId field is of type CliqueId, which is a custom type defined in the Alephium protocol model. It represents the ID of the clique (a group of nodes that work together to validate transactions) that the peer node belongs to.

The brokerId field is an integer that represents the ID of the broker that the peer node is connected to. A broker is a node that acts as a gateway between cliques.

The groupNumPerBroker field is also an integer and represents the number of groups that the broker is responsible for.

The address field is an InetSocketAddress object that contains the IP address and port number of the peer node.

The isSynced field is a boolean that indicates whether the peer node is in sync with the rest of the network.

The clientVersion field is a string that represents the version of the Alephium client that the peer node is running.

This class is likely used in the Alephium API to provide information about the network to clients. For example, a client could use this information to determine which nodes are available to connect to and which nodes are in sync with the network. Here is an example of how this class could be used:

```scala
val peerInfo = InterCliquePeerInfo(
  cliqueId = CliqueId(123),
  brokerId = 1,
  groupNumPerBroker = 2,
  address = new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 8080),
  isSynced = true,
  clientVersion = "1.0.0"
)

println(peerInfo.address) // prints "127.0.0.1:8080"
println(peerInfo.isSynced) // prints "true"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InterCliquePeerInfo` case class?
   - The `InterCliquePeerInfo` case class is used to represent information about a peer node in the Alephium network, including its clique ID, broker ID, network address, synchronization status, and client version.

2. What is the significance of the `cliqueId` and `brokerId` fields?
   - The `cliqueId` field represents the ID of the clique (sub-network) that the peer node belongs to, while the `brokerId` field represents the ID of the broker (leader node) within the clique that the peer node is connected to.

3. What is the expected format of the `address` field?
   - The `address` field is of type `InetSocketAddress`, which represents a network socket address (IP address and port number) that the peer node can be reached at. The format of the address is expected to be a valid IP address and a port number in the range of 1 to 65535.
