The `UtilJson` object provides various implicit conversions and definitions for JSON serialization and deserialization of certain types used in the Alephium project. 

The object defines implicit conversions for serializing and deserializing `AVector`, a custom vector implementation used in the project. It also provides an implicit conversion for serializing and deserializing `BigInteger` objects to and from JSON. Additionally, it defines conversions for serializing and deserializing `ByteString` objects, which are used to represent binary data as hexadecimal strings. 

The object also provides conversions for serializing and deserializing `InetAddress` and `InetSocketAddress` objects, which are used to represent network addresses. Finally, it defines conversions for serializing and deserializing `TimeStamp` objects, which represent a point in time.

These conversions are used throughout the Alephium project to convert various types to and from JSON format. For example, the `InetSocketAddress` conversion is used to serialize and deserialize network addresses when communicating with other nodes in the Alephium network. 

Overall, the `UtilJson` object provides a set of useful conversions for JSON serialization and deserialization of various types used in the Alephium project.
