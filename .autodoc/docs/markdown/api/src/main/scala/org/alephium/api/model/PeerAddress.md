This code defines a case class called `PeerAddress` that represents the network address of a peer in the Alephium network. The `PeerAddress` class has four fields: `address`, which is an `InetAddress` object representing the IP address of the peer, `restPort`, which is an integer representing the port number for the peer's REST API, `wsPort`, which is an integer representing the port number for the peer's WebSocket API, and `minerApiPort`, which is an integer representing the port number for the peer's miner API.

This class is likely used in the larger Alephium project to manage connections to other nodes in the network. When a node wants to connect to another node, it can create a `PeerAddress` object with the appropriate IP address and port numbers, and use this object to establish a connection. The `PeerAddress` class provides a convenient way to store and manage this information.

Here is an example of how the `PeerAddress` class might be used in the Alephium project:

```
import org.alephium.api.model.PeerAddress

val peer = PeerAddress(InetAddress.getByName("192.168.1.100"), 8080, 8081, 8082)

// Use the peer object to establish a connection to the peer's REST API
val restApi = new RestApi(peer.address, peer.restPort)

// Use the peer object to establish a connection to the peer's WebSocket API
val wsApi = new WebSocketApi(peer.address, peer.wsPort)

// Use the peer object to establish a connection to the peer's miner API
val minerApi = new MinerApi(peer.address, peer.minerApiPort)
```

In this example, we create a `PeerAddress` object representing a peer with IP address "192.168.1.100" and REST, WebSocket, and miner API ports 8080, 8081, and 8082, respectively. We then use this object to establish connections to the peer's REST, WebSocket, and miner APIs.
