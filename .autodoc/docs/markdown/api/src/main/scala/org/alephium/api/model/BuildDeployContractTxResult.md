This file contains the implementation of the `BuildDeployContractTxResult` class, which is used to represent the result of building and deploying a smart contract transaction on the Alephium blockchain. 

The `BuildDeployContractTxResult` class is a case class that contains the following fields:
- `fromGroup`: an integer representing the group from which the transaction originates
- `toGroup`: an integer representing the group to which the transaction is sent
- `unsignedTx`: a string representing the serialized unsigned transaction
- `gasAmount`: a `GasBox` object representing the amount of gas used by the transaction
- `gasPrice`: a `GasPrice` object representing the price of gas used by the transaction
- `txId`: a `TransactionId` object representing the ID of the transaction
- `contractAddress`: an `Address.Contract` object representing the address of the deployed contract

The `BuildDeployContractTxResult` class extends two traits: `GasInfo` and `ChainIndexInfo`. The `GasInfo` trait defines methods for getting the gas amount and gas price of a transaction, while the `ChainIndexInfo` trait defines methods for getting the chain index of a transaction.

The `BuildDeployContractTxResult` object contains a single method, `from`, which takes an `UnsignedTransaction` object and a `GroupConfig` object as input and returns a `BuildDeployContractTxResult` object. The `from` method is used to create a `BuildDeployContractTxResult` object from an `UnsignedTransaction` object. It does this by extracting the necessary information from the `UnsignedTransaction` object and using it to initialize the fields of the `BuildDeployContractTxResult` object.

Overall, this code provides a way to represent the result of building and deploying a smart contract transaction on the Alephium blockchain. It can be used in the larger project to facilitate the creation and deployment of smart contracts. For example, a developer could use this code to build a smart contract transaction, deploy it to the blockchain, and then use the resulting `BuildDeployContractTxResult` object to obtain information about the deployed contract, such as its address and gas usage.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BuildDeployContractTxResult` class?
   - The `BuildDeployContractTxResult` class represents the result of building and deploying a contract transaction, including information such as the unsigned transaction, gas amount, gas price, transaction ID, and contract address.

2. What is the `from` method in the `BuildDeployContractTxResult` object used for?
   - The `from` method is used to create a `BuildDeployContractTxResult` instance from an `UnsignedTransaction` object, using information from the `GroupConfig` object.

3. What is the purpose of the `GasInfo` and `ChainIndexInfo` traits that `BuildDeployContractTxResult` extends?
   - The `GasInfo` trait provides information about the gas used in the transaction, while the `ChainIndexInfo` trait provides information about the chain index of the transaction. These traits are used to provide additional context about the transaction result.
