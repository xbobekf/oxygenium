This code defines a case class called `SweepAddressTransaction` and an object with the same name. The case class has four fields: `txId`, which is a `TransactionId` object; `unsignedTx`, which is a string representation of an `UnsignedTransaction` object; `gasAmount`, which is a `GasBox` object; and `gasPrice`, which is a `GasPrice` object. The object `SweepAddressTransaction` has a single method called `from` that takes an `UnsignedTransaction` object as input and returns a `SweepAddressTransaction` object.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to represent a transaction that sweeps funds from an address. The `SweepAddressTransaction` object is used to store information about such a transaction, including the transaction ID, the unsigned transaction, the gas amount, and the gas price. The `from` method is a convenience method that takes an `UnsignedTransaction` object and returns a `SweepAddressTransaction` object with the relevant information.

This code is likely used in the larger Alephium project to facilitate the creation and processing of transactions that sweep funds from an address. For example, it may be used in a wallet application that allows users to sweep funds from multiple addresses into a single address. The `SweepAddressTransaction` object could be used to represent each of these transactions, and the `from` method could be used to convert an `UnsignedTransaction` object into a `SweepAddressTransaction` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SweepAddressTransaction` class?
   - The `SweepAddressTransaction` class represents a transaction that sweeps funds from an address to another and includes gas information.

2. What is the `from` method in the `SweepAddressTransaction` object used for?
   - The `from` method is used to create a `SweepAddressTransaction` instance from an `UnsignedTransaction` instance by extracting relevant information.

3. What is the `GasInfo` trait that `SweepAddressTransaction` extends?
   - The `GasInfo` trait is a marker trait that indicates that a class contains gas information.
