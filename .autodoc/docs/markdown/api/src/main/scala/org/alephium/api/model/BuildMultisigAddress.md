This file contains two case classes, `BuildMultisigAddress` and `BuildMultisigAddressResult`, which are used to build a multisig address in the Alephium project. 

A multisig address is an address that requires multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. In the case of Alephium, a multisig address is created by combining multiple public keys and specifying the number of signatures required to authorize a transaction. 

The `BuildMultisigAddress` case class takes in a vector of `PublicKey` objects and an integer `mrequired`, which specifies the number of signatures required to authorize a transaction. The `BuildMultisigAddressResult` case class contains the resulting multisig address.

This code can be used in the larger Alephium project to create multisig addresses for transactions that require multiple parties to authorize. For example, if a group of users wants to pool their funds together and require a majority vote to authorize transactions, they can use this code to create a multisig address that requires a certain number of signatures to authorize transactions. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the Alephium project:

```
import org.alephium.api.model.BuildMultisigAddress
import org.alephium.protocol.PublicKey
import org.alephium.protocol.model.Address
import org.alephium.util.AVector

val keys: AVector[PublicKey] = AVector(PublicKey("publickey1"), PublicKey("publickey2"), PublicKey("publickey3"))
val mrequired: Int = 2

val multisigAddress = BuildMultisigAddress(keys, mrequired)
val result = BuildMultisigAddressResult(Address.fromString("multisigaddress"))

println(result.address) // prints the multisig address created
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BuildMultisigAddress` case class?
   - The `BuildMultisigAddress` case class is used to represent a request to build a multisig address with a given set of public keys and a required number of signatures.
2. What is the expected output of the `BuildMultisigAddressResult` case class?
   - The `BuildMultisigAddressResult` case class is expected to contain the resulting multisig address after the `BuildMultisigAddress` request has been processed.
3. What other dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has dependencies on other packages and modules within the `alephium` project, including `org.alephium.protocol.PublicKey`, `org.alephium.protocol.model.Address`, and `org.alephium.util.AVector`.
