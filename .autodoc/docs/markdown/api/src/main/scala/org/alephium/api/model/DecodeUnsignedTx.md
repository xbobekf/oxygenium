This file contains two case classes, `DecodeUnsignedTx` and `DecodeUnsignedTxResult`, which are used in the Alephium project's API model. 

`DecodeUnsignedTx` takes in a string representing an unsigned transaction and creates an instance of the case class. This case class is used to decode an unsigned transaction and extract information from it. 

`DecodeUnsignedTxResult` is the result of decoding an unsigned transaction. It contains information about the transaction, including the sender group (`fromGroup`), recipient group (`toGroup`), and the unsigned transaction itself (`unsignedTx`). This case class extends `ChainIndexInfo`, which is a trait used to represent information about a block or transaction in the Alephium blockchain. 

These case classes are used in the larger Alephium project to provide functionality for decoding unsigned transactions and extracting information from them. For example, a user may want to decode an unsigned transaction to verify its contents before signing and submitting it to the network. 

Here is an example of how these case classes may be used in the Alephium project:

```
val unsignedTxString = "abcdefg"
val decodedTx = DecodeUnsignedTx(unsignedTxString)
val result = DecodeUnsignedTxResult(1, 2, UnsignedTx(...))
```

In this example, `unsignedTxString` represents the string representation of an unsigned transaction. `decodedTx` is an instance of `DecodeUnsignedTx` created from `unsignedTxString`. `result` is an instance of `DecodeUnsignedTxResult` containing information about the decoded transaction, including the sender group (`1`), recipient group (`2`), and the unsigned transaction itself (`UnsignedTx(...)`).
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DecodeUnsignedTx` case class?
   - The `DecodeUnsignedTx` case class is used to represent an unsigned transaction that needs to be decoded.
2. What is the `DecodeUnsignedTxResult` case class used for?
   - The `DecodeUnsignedTxResult` case class is used to represent the result of decoding an unsigned transaction, including the from and to groups and the decoded unsigned transaction.
3. What is the `ChainIndexInfo` trait that `DecodeUnsignedTxResult` extends?
   - The `ChainIndexInfo` trait is a trait that provides additional information about a chain index, which is likely relevant to the context of the `DecodeUnsignedTxResult`.
