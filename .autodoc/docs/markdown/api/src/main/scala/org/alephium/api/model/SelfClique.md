This code defines a Scala case class called `SelfClique` that represents a clique of nodes in the Alephium network. A clique is a group of nodes that are connected to each other and work together to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain. 

The `SelfClique` class has four fields: `cliqueId`, which is a unique identifier for the clique; `nodes`, which is a vector of `PeerAddress` objects representing the network addresses of the nodes in the clique; `selfReady`, which is a boolean indicating whether the local node is ready to participate in the clique; and `synced`, which is a boolean indicating whether the local node is fully synchronized with the rest of the network.

The class also defines two methods. The first, `brokerNum`, returns the number of nodes in the clique. The second, `peer`, takes a `GroupIndex` object as input and returns the `PeerAddress` of the node in the clique that corresponds to that index. The index is calculated as the remainder of the group index value divided by the number of nodes in the clique. This method is used to determine which node in the clique should receive a particular message or transaction.

This code is part of the Alephium API, which provides a set of functions for interacting with the Alephium blockchain. The `SelfClique` class is used to represent the local node's view of the clique it belongs to. This information is used by other parts of the API to route messages and transactions to the appropriate nodes in the network. For example, when a new transaction is submitted to the network, the API uses the `peer` method to determine which node in the clique should receive the transaction first. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the Alephium API's functionality for managing the network of nodes that maintain the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SelfClique` case class?
   - The `SelfClique` case class represents a clique of nodes in the Alephium network, and contains information about the clique ID, nodes, and their readiness and synchronization status.

2. What is the `brokerNum` method used for?
   - The `brokerNum` method returns the number of nodes in the clique, which is used to calculate the index of a peer in the `nodes` vector.

3. What is the `peer` method used for?
   - The `peer` method returns the `PeerAddress` of a node in the clique, based on its `GroupIndex`. The index is wrapped around the number of nodes in the clique using the modulo operator.
