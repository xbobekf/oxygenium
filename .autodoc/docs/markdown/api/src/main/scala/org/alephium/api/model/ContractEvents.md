This file contains code for defining and manipulating various data structures related to contract events in the Alephium project. 

The `ContractEvent` class represents an event that occurred during the execution of a smart contract. It contains information such as the block hash, transaction ID, event index, and a vector of values representing the event's fields. 

The `ContractEvents` class is a wrapper around a vector of `ContractEvent` instances, along with a `nextStart` field that indicates the index of the next event to be retrieved. The `ContractEventsByTxId` and `ContractEventsByBlockHash` classes are similar, but are indexed by transaction ID and block hash, respectively. 

The `ContractEventByTxId` and `ContractEventByBlockHash` classes are used to represent contract events in a more compact form, with the contract address and event index being the only required fields. These classes also contain methods for extracting the contract ID from the event's fields. 

The `from` methods in the `ContractEventByTxId` and `ContractEventByBlockHash` companion objects are used to create instances of these classes from `LogState` and `LogStateRef` instances. The `from` methods in the `ContractEvents` companion object are used to create instances of `ContractEvent` and `ContractEvents` from `LogStates` instances. 

Overall, this code provides a way to represent and manipulate contract events in the Alephium project. It can be used to retrieve and analyze information about smart contract executions, which is useful for debugging and monitoring purposes. 

Example usage:

```scala
import org.alephium.api.model._

// create a ContractEvent instance
val event = ContractEvent(
  blockHash = BlockHash("abc123"),
  txId = TransactionId("def456"),
  eventIndex = 0,
  fields = AVector(ValInt(42), ValString("hello"))
)

// create a ContractEvents instance
val events = ContractEvents(
  events = AVector(event),
  nextStart = 1
)

// create a ContractEventByTxId instance
val eventByTxId = ContractEventByTxId(
  blockHash = BlockHash("abc123"),
  contractAddress = Address.Contract(LockupScript.P2C(ContractId(123))),
  eventIndex = 0,
  fields = AVector(ValAddress(Address.Contract(LockupScript.P2C(ContractId(123)))))
)

// create a ContractEventByBlockHash instance
val eventByBlockHash = ContractEventByBlockHash(
  txId = TransactionId("def456"),
  contractAddress = Address.Contract(LockupScript.P2C(ContractId(123))),
  eventIndex = 0,
  fields = AVector(ValInt(42), ValString("hello"))
)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ContractEvents` class and its related classes?
- The `ContractEvents` class and its related classes (`ContractEventsByTxId`, `ContractEventsByBlockHash`, `ContractEvent`, `ContractEventByTxId`, and `ContractEventByBlockHash`) are used to represent events emitted by smart contracts in the Alephium blockchain.

2. What is the `Val` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `Val` class is used to represent the value of a field in a smart contract event. It is used in the `ContractEvent`, `ContractEventByTxId`, and `ContractEventByBlockHash` classes to store the values of the fields emitted by a smart contract.

3. What is the purpose of the `from` methods in the `ContractEventByTxId` and `ContractEventByBlockHash` objects?
- The `from` methods in the `ContractEventByTxId` and `ContractEventByBlockHash` objects are used to create instances of these classes from `LogStateRef` and `LogState` objects. They are used to convert the raw data emitted by a smart contract into a more structured format that can be used by the `ContractEvents` class.
