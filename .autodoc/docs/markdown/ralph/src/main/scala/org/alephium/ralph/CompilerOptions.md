[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/ralph/src/main/scala/org/alephium/ralph/CompilerOptions.scala)

The code defines a case class called `CompilerOptions` and an object with the same name. The `CompilerOptions` case class takes in six boolean parameters that represent different compiler options. These options are used to control the warnings that are generated by the compiler. The options include `ignoreUnusedConstantsWarnings`, `ignoreUnusedVariablesWarnings`, `ignoreUnusedFieldsWarnings`, `ignoreUnusedPrivateFunctionsWarnings`, `ignoreUpdateFieldsCheckWarnings`, and `ignoreCheckExternalCallerWarnings`. 

The `CompilerOptions` object defines a default set of options that can be used if no options are specified. The default options are set to `false` for all the boolean parameters. 

This code is part of the Alephium project and is used to configure the compiler options for the project. By using the `CompilerOptions` case class, the project can easily define and manage different sets of compiler options. For example, if the project wants to ignore warnings related to unused constants, it can create a new instance of the `CompilerOptions` case class and set the `ignoreUnusedConstantsWarnings` parameter to `true`. 

Here is an example of how the `CompilerOptions` case class can be used:

```
val options = CompilerOptions(ignoreUnusedConstantsWarnings = true)
```

This creates a new instance of the `CompilerOptions` case class with the `ignoreUnusedConstantsWarnings` parameter set to `true`. This instance can then be passed to the compiler to configure the compiler options for the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompilerOptions` class?
   - The `CompilerOptions` class is used to store various options related to the compiler, such as whether to ignore certain types of warnings.
2. What is the `Default` object?
   - The `Default` object is an instance of the `CompilerOptions` class with default values for all options.
