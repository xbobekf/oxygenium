This file contains code for the `SourcePosition` class and its companion object. The `SourcePosition` class is a case class that represents a position in a source code file. It takes two parameters, `rowNum` and `colNum`, which represent the line number and column number of the position, respectively. The `SourcePosition` class has three methods: `rowIndex`, `colIndex`, and `format`. The `rowIndex` method returns the zero-based index of the row, `colIndex` returns the zero-based index of the column, and `format` returns a string representation of the position in the format `(rowNum:colNum)`.

The companion object contains a single method, `parse`, which takes a string of the format `int:int` and returns a `SourcePosition` object. The `parse` method splits the input string on the `:` character and attempts to convert the resulting substrings to integers. If successful, it returns a new `SourcePosition` object with the parsed row and column numbers. If the input string is not in the expected format or the conversion to integers fails, the method throws a `Compiler.Error` with a message indicating the unsupported line number format.

This code is likely used in the larger project to represent positions in source code files, such as for error reporting or debugging purposes. The `parse` method may be used to convert user input or other data into `SourcePosition` objects. For example, if a user enters a line and column number in a text editor, the `parse` method could be used to convert that input into a `SourcePosition` object that can be used elsewhere in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `alephium` project?
- The purpose of the `alephium` project is not clear from this code file.

2. What is the purpose of the `SourcePosition` class?
- The `SourcePosition` class represents a position in the source code, with a row number and column number. It also provides a method to parse a line number string into a `SourcePosition` object.

3. What happens if the input format to the `parse` method is invalid?
- If the input format to the `parse` method is invalid, an exception is thrown with an error message indicating that the line number format is unsupported.
