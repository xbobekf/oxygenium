This file contains code related to typed compiler errors for the Alephium project. The code defines a set of error messages that can be produced by the compiler, which are used to provide feedback to the user when there is an issue with their code. 

The `CompilerError` trait is the base trait for all compiler errors, and it defines a `message` method that returns a string representation of the error. The `FormattableError` trait extends `CompilerError` and adds additional methods for formatting the error message. The `SyntaxError` and `TypeError` traits extend `FormattableError` and define specific types of errors that can occur during compilation. 

The `FastParseError` case class is used to represent errors produced by the FastParse library, which is used for parsing the Alephium language. It contains information about the position of the error in the program, the error message, the found input, and a traced message. The `Expected an I256 value` and `Expected an U256 value` case classes are used to represent errors where an integer value is expected but a different type of value is found. The `Expected an immutable variable` case class is used to represent errors where a mutable variable is used in a context where an immutable variable is expected. The `Expected main statements` case class is used to represent errors where the main statements for a type are missing. The `Expected non-empty asset(s) for address` case class is used to represent errors where an address is missing assets. The `Expected else statement` case class is used to represent errors where an `else` statement is expected but not found. The `Invalid byteVec`, `Invalid number`, `Invalid contract address`, and `Invalid address` case classes are used to represent errors where a value of the wrong type is used. 

Overall, this code provides a set of error messages that can be used to provide feedback to users when there is an issue with their code during compilation. These error messages can be used to help users identify and fix issues in their code more easily.
