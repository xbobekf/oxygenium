This code defines a case class called "Sweep" that is used in the Alephium wallet API. The purpose of this class is to represent a request to sweep all the funds from a given address to another address. 

The "Sweep" class has several parameters, including the "toAddress" parameter, which specifies the destination address for the swept funds. The "lockTime" parameter is an optional timestamp that can be used to specify a time at which the swept funds should become spendable. The "gasAmount" parameter is an optional amount of gas to be used in the transaction, while the "gasPrice" parameter is an optional gas price to be used. The "utxosLimit" parameter is an optional limit on the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to be included in the transaction, while the "targetBlockHash" parameter is an optional target block hash for the transaction.

The "Sweep" class extends the "BuildTxCommon" trait, which provides common functionality for building transactions. This suggests that the "Sweep" class is used as part of a larger system for building and executing transactions in the Alephium wallet API.

Here is an example of how the "Sweep" class might be used:

```
val sweepRequest = Sweep(
  toAddress = Address.Asset("0x1234567890abcdef"),
  lockTime = Some(TimeStamp.now.plusDays(7)),
  gasAmount = Some(GasBox(100000)),
  gasPrice = Some(GasPrice(1000000000)),
  utxosLimit = Some(10),
  targetBlockHash = Some(BlockHash("0xabcdef1234567890"))
)
```

In this example, a new "Sweep" object is created with the destination address "0x1234567890abcdef", a lock time of 7 days from now, a gas amount of 100000, a gas price of 1000000000, a UTXO limit of 10, and a target block hash of "0xabcdef1234567890". This object could then be used as part of a larger system for building and executing transactions in the Alephium wallet API.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Sweep` case class?
   - The `Sweep` case class is used to represent a transaction that sweeps all available funds from a given address to another address.

2. What are the optional parameters of the `Sweep` case class?
   - The optional parameters of the `Sweep` case class are `lockTime`, `gasAmount`, `gasPrice`, `utxosLimit`, and `targetBlockHash`. These parameters allow for customization of the transaction.

3. What other classes are imported in this file?
   - This file imports classes from the `org.alephium.api.model`, `org.alephium.protocol.model`, `org.alephium.protocol.vm`, and `org.alephium.util` packages. These classes are likely used elsewhere in the `alephium` project.
