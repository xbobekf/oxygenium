This file contains two case classes that are used in the Alephium wallet API. The first case class is called `WalletRestore` and it represents the data needed to restore a wallet. It contains the following fields:

- `password`: a string representing the password for the wallet.
- `mnemonic`: an instance of the `Mnemonic` class, which represents the mnemonic phrase used to generate the wallet's private key.
- `walletName`: a string representing the name of the wallet.
- `isMiner`: an optional boolean value indicating whether the wallet is a miner or not.
- `mnemonicPassphrase`: an optional string representing the passphrase used to generate the mnemonic phrase.

The second case class is called `WalletRestoreResult` and it represents the result of a wallet restoration operation. It contains a single field:

- `walletName`: a string representing the name of the restored wallet.

These case classes are used in the Alephium wallet API to allow users to restore their wallets using a mnemonic phrase and a password. The `WalletRestore` case class is used to collect the necessary data from the user, while the `WalletRestoreResult` case class is used to return the name of the restored wallet to the user.

Here is an example of how these case classes might be used in the Alephium wallet API:

```scala
val password = "myPassword"
val mnemonic = Mnemonic("abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about")
val walletName = "myWallet"

val walletRestore = WalletRestore(password, mnemonic, walletName)
val walletRestoreResult = WalletRestoreResult(walletName)

// Use walletRestore to restore the wallet
// ...

// Return walletRestoreResult to the user
// ...
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WalletRestore` case class?
   - The `WalletRestore` case class is used to represent the data needed to restore a wallet, including the password, mnemonic, wallet name, and optional flags for whether the wallet is a miner and whether a mnemonic passphrase is used.

2. What is the purpose of the `WalletRestoreResult` case class?
   - The `WalletRestoreResult` case class is used to represent the result of a wallet restore operation, containing only the name of the restored wallet.

3. What is the relationship between this code and the Alephium project?
   - This code is part of the Alephium project, as indicated by the copyright notice and package name. It is likely used in the Alephium wallet API.
