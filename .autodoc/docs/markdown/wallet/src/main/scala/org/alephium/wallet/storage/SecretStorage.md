This file contains the implementation of a trait called `SecretStorage` and an object called `SecretStorage` that provides methods to load, create, and manipulate secret storage files. The `SecretStorage` trait defines an interface for a secret storage that can store and retrieve private keys and other sensitive information. The `SecretStorage` object provides methods to create, load, and manipulate secret storage files.

The `SecretStorage` trait defines the following methods:

- `lock()`: locks the secret storage.
- `unlock(password: String, mnemonicPassphrase: Option[String]): Either[SecretStorage.Error, Unit]`: unlocks the secret storage with the given password and optional mnemonic passphrase.
- `delete(password: String): Either[SecretStorage.Error, Unit]`: deletes the secret storage with the given password.
- `isLocked(): Boolean`: returns true if the secret storage is locked.
- `isMiner(): Either[SecretStorage.Error, Boolean]`: returns true if the secret storage is a miner.
- `getActivePrivateKey(): Either[SecretStorage.Error, ExtendedPrivateKey]`: returns the active private key.
- `getAllPrivateKeys(): Either[SecretStorage.Error, (ExtendedPrivateKey, AVector[ExtendedPrivateKey])]`: returns all private keys.
- `deriveNextKey(): Either[SecretStorage.Error, ExtendedPrivateKey]`: derives the next private key.
- `changeActiveKey(key: ExtendedPrivateKey): Either[SecretStorage.Error, Unit]`: changes the active private key.
- `revealMnemonic(password: String): Either[SecretStorage.Error, Mnemonic]`: reveals the mnemonic with the given password.

The `SecretStorage` object provides the following methods:

- `load(file: File, path: AVector[Int]): Either[Error, SecretStorage]`: loads a secret storage file from the given file path and returns a `SecretStorage` instance.
- `create(mnemonic: Mnemonic, mnemonicPassphrase: Option[String], password: String, isMiner: Boolean, file: File, path: AVector[Int]): Either[Error, SecretStorage]`: creates a new secret storage file with the given mnemonic, mnemonic passphrase, password, and path, and returns a `SecretStorage` instance.
- `fromFile(file: File, password: String, path: AVector[Int], mnemonicPassphrase: Option[String]): Either[Error, SecretStorage]`: returns a `SecretStorage` instance from the given file path, password, path, and mnemonic passphrase.
- `decryptStateFile(file: File, password: String): Either[Error, ByteString]`: decrypts the state file with the given password.
- `storedStateFromFile(file: File, password: String): Either[Error, StoredState]`: returns the stored state from the given file path and password.
- `stateFromFile(file: File, password: String, path: AVector[Int], mnemonicPassphrase: Option[String]): Either[Error, State]`: returns the state from the given file path, password, path, and mnemonic passphrase.
- `revealMnemonicFromFile(file: File, password: String): Either[Error, Mnemonic]`: reveals the mnemonic from the given file path and password.
- `validatePassword(file: File, password: String): Either[Error, Unit]`: validates the password for the given file path.
- `deriveKeys(seed: ByteString, number: Int, path: AVector[Int]): Either[Error, AVector[ExtendedPrivateKey]]`: derives the private keys from the given seed, number, and path.
- `storeStateToFile(file: File, storedState: StoredState, password: String): Either[Error, Unit]`: stores the state to the given file path and password.

Overall, this code provides a secure way to store and retrieve private keys and other sensitive information. It can be used in a larger project that requires secure storage of private keys, such as a cryptocurrency wallet.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SecretStorage` trait and what methods does it define?
- The `SecretStorage` trait defines methods for managing and accessing secret information such as private keys and mnemonics. It defines methods for locking and unlocking the storage, deleting the stored information, checking if the storage is locked, retrieving private keys and mnemonics, deriving new private keys, changing the active key, and revealing the mnemonic.

2. How is the state of the `SecretStorage` managed and updated?
- The state of the `SecretStorage` is managed and updated through the `Impl` class, which implements the `SecretStorage` trait. The `Impl` class defines methods for updating the state, such as `deriveNextKey` and `changeActiveKey`, which modify the private key information stored in the state. The state is updated by calling the `updateState` method, which takes a new state as an argument and updates the stored state in the file.

3. What encryption and decryption methods are used to protect the stored information?
- The stored information is encrypted using the AES encryption algorithm, with a randomly generated salt and initialization vector (IV). The `AES` object provides methods for encrypting and decrypting the information. The password provided by the user is used as the encryption key. The `SecretFile` case class stores the encrypted information along with the salt, IV, and version number. The `decryptStateFile` method decrypts the information from the file using the password and returns the decrypted bytes.
