The code defines a Scala case class `Balances` and a companion object `Balances` with a nested case class `AddressBalance`. The `Balances` case class has three fields: `totalBalance`, `totalBalanceHint`, and `balances`. The `totalBalance` field is of type `Amount` and represents the total balance of all addresses. The `totalBalanceHint` field is of type `Amount.Hint` and represents a hint for the total balance. The `balances` field is of type `AVector[Balances.AddressBalance]` and represents a vector of `AddressBalance` objects.

The `AddressBalance` case class has six fields: `address`, `balance`, `balanceHint`, `lockedBalance`, `lockedBalanceHint`, and `warning`. The `address` field is of type `Address.Asset` and represents the address. The `balance` field is of type `Amount` and represents the balance of the address. The `balanceHint` field is of type `Amount.Hint` and represents a hint for the balance. The `lockedBalance` field is of type `Amount` and represents the locked balance of the address. The `lockedBalanceHint` field is of type `Amount.Hint` and represents a hint for the locked balance. The `warning` field is an optional string that represents a warning message.

The `Balances` companion object has a `from` method that takes a `totalBalance` of type `Amount` and a vector of `balances` of type `AVector[Balances.AddressBalance]` and returns a new `Balances` object with the same fields. The `AddressBalance` companion object has a `from` method that takes an `address` of type `Address.Asset`, a `balance` of type `Amount`, a `lockedBalance` of type `Amount`, and an optional `warning` of type `Option[String]` and returns a new `AddressBalance` object with the same fields.

This code is likely used to represent and manipulate balances of addresses in the Alephium wallet API. The `Balances` case class represents the total balance of all addresses and a vector of `AddressBalance` objects that represent the balances of individual addresses. The `AddressBalance` case class represents the balance and locked balance of an address, as well as an optional warning message. The `from` methods in the companion objects are likely used to create new `Balances` and `AddressBalance` objects from existing data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Balances` class and how is it used?
- The `Balances` class represents a collection of balances for different addresses and includes a total balance and balance hints. It can be created using the `from` method and contains a vector of `AddressBalance` objects.

2. What is the `AddressBalance` class and what information does it contain?
- The `AddressBalance` class represents the balance information for a single address and includes the address, balance, locked balance, balance hints, and an optional warning message.

3. What is the purpose of the `from` method in both the `Balances` and `AddressBalance` classes?
- The `from` method is a convenience method that creates a new instance of the class with the specified parameters and returns it. It is used to simplify the creation of new objects and avoid the need to specify all the parameters every time.
