This code defines a trait called `WalletEndpointsLogic` that provides the implementation for various endpoints related to wallet functionality. The trait extends another trait called `WalletEndpoints` which defines the signatures of these endpoints. The `WalletEndpointsLogic` trait is used to implement these endpoints by providing the necessary logic for each endpoint.

The `WalletEndpointsLogic` trait defines several methods that correspond to the endpoints defined in the `WalletEndpoints` trait. These methods include `createWalletLogic`, `restoreWalletLogic`, `lockWalletLogic`, `unlockWalletLogic`, `deleteWalletLogic`, `getBalancesLogic`, `getAddressesLogic`, `getAddressInfoLogic`, `getMinerAddressesLogic`, `revealMnemonicLogic`, `transferLogic`, `sweepActiveAddressLogic`, `sweepAllAddressesLogic`, `signLogic`, `deriveNextAddressLogic`, `deriveNextMinerAddressesLogic`, `changeActiveAddressLogic`, `listWalletsLogic`, and `getWalletLogic`.

Each of these methods takes input parameters that correspond to the input parameters of the corresponding endpoint defined in the `WalletEndpoints` trait. The methods then use the `walletService` object to perform the necessary operations and return the results in the appropriate format.

For example, the `createWalletLogic` method takes a `walletCreation` object as input, which contains the necessary parameters to create a new wallet. The method then calls the `createWallet` method of the `walletService` object to create the wallet and returns the result in the appropriate format.

Similarly, the `getBalancesLogic` method takes a `wallet` object as input and calls the `getBalances` method of the `walletService` object to get the balances for the specified wallet. The method then returns the result in the appropriate format.

Overall, this code provides the implementation for various wallet-related endpoints that can be used in the larger project. These endpoints allow users to create, restore, lock, unlock, delete, and manage wallets, as well as perform various operations such as transferring funds, signing data, and deriving new addresses.
## Questions:
