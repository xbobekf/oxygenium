[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/wallet/src/main/scala/org/alephium/wallet/api/model/ChangeActiveAddress.scala)

This code defines a case class called `ChangeActiveAddress` that is used in the Alephium wallet API. The purpose of this class is to represent a request to change the active address for a particular asset. 

The `ChangeActiveAddress` class takes a single parameter, `address`, which is an instance of the `Address.Asset` class. This class represents an address for a specific asset on the Alephium blockchain. 

By creating an instance of the `ChangeActiveAddress` class with a new `Address.Asset` object, a user can send a request to the Alephium wallet API to change the active address for a particular asset. This can be useful in situations where a user wants to switch to a different address for a particular asset, such as when they want to use a different wallet or move their funds to a different address for security reasons. 

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the Alephium wallet API, allowing users to easily change their active address for a specific asset. An example usage of this code might look like:

```
val newAddress = Address.Asset("assetId", "newAddress")
val changeRequest = ChangeActiveAddress(newAddress)
// send changeRequest to Alephium wallet API
```
## Questions:
