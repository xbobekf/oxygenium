The code above defines a case class called `WalletStatus` that is used in the Alephium wallet API. The purpose of this class is to represent the status of a wallet, including its name and whether it is currently locked or not.

The `WalletStatus` class is defined as `final`, which means that it cannot be extended or subclassed. It has two fields: `walletName`, which is a string that represents the name of the wallet, and `locked`, which is a boolean that indicates whether the wallet is currently locked or not.

This class is likely used in the larger Alephium project to provide information about the status of a user's wallet. For example, when a user logs into their wallet, the API may return a `WalletStatus` object that indicates whether their wallet is currently locked or not. This information can then be used to determine whether the user needs to enter their password to unlock the wallet before they can perform any transactions.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the Alephium wallet API:

```scala
import org.alephium.wallet.api.model.WalletStatus

val walletName = "my_wallet"
val isLocked = true

val walletStatus = WalletStatus(walletName, isLocked)

// Print out the status of the wallet
println(s"Wallet ${walletStatus.walletName} is currently ${if (walletStatus.locked) "locked" else "unlocked"}")
```

In this example, we create a new `WalletStatus` object with the name "my_wallet" and a locked status of `true`. We then print out the status of the wallet using the `walletName` and `locked` fields of the `WalletStatus` object. The output of this code would be "Wallet my_wallet is currently locked".
