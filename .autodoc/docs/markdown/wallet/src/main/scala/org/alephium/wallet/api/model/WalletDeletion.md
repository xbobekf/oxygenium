[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/wallet/src/main/scala/org/alephium/wallet/api/model/WalletDeletion.scala)

This code defines a case class called `WalletDeletion` that takes a single parameter `password` of type `String`. This case class is located in the `org.alephium.wallet.api.model` package.

The purpose of this case class is to represent a request to delete a wallet. The `password` parameter is used to authenticate the user and ensure that only authorized users can delete a wallet.

This case class can be used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the `alephium` project to implement a wallet deletion feature. For example, a user interface could prompt the user to enter their password and then create an instance of the `WalletDeletion` case class with the entered password. This instance could then be passed to a method that handles wallet deletion, which would verify the password and delete the wallet if the password is correct.

Here is an example of how this case class could be used in code:

```scala
import org.alephium.wallet.api.model.WalletDeletion

val password = "myPassword123"
val walletDeletion = WalletDeletion(password)

// pass the walletDeletion instance to a method that handles wallet deletion
deleteWallet(walletDeletion)
``` 

Overall, this code provides a simple and straightforward way to represent a wallet deletion request in the `alephium` project.
