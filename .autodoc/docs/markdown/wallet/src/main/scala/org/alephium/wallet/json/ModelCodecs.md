This code defines a set of implicit JSON codecs for various models used in the Alephium wallet. These codecs allow for easy serialization and deserialization of these models to and from JSON format. 

The `ModelCodecs` trait extends the `ApiModelCodec` trait and defines implicit codecs for the following models: `Addresses`, `AddressInfo`, `MinerAddressesInfo`, `Balances.AddressBalance`, `Balances`, `ChangeActiveAddress`, `Transfer`, `Sign`, `SignResult`, `Sweep`, `TransferResult`, `TransferResults`, `Mnemonic`, `WalletUnlock`, `WalletDeletion`, `WalletRestore`, `WalletRestoreResult`, `WalletCreation`, `WalletCreationResult`, `WalletStatus`, `RevealMnemonic`, and `RevealMnemonicResult`. 

For example, the `addressesRW` codec is defined for the `Addresses` model, which represents a list of addresses. This codec is defined using the `macroRW` macro, which generates a read-write codec for the model based on its case class definition. 

These codecs are used throughout the Alephium wallet to serialize and deserialize JSON data for various API requests and responses. For example, the `transferRW` codec is used to serialize a `Transfer` model to JSON when making a transfer request to the Alephium API. 

Overall, this code plays an important role in enabling communication between the Alephium wallet and the Alephium API by providing a standardized way to encode and decode data in JSON format.
