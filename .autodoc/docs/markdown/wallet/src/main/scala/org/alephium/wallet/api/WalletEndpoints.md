This code defines the endpoints for the wallet API of the Alephium project. The endpoints are defined using the Tapir library, which provides a type-safe and composable way to define HTTP endpoints in Scala. 

The `WalletEndpoints` trait defines a set of endpoints that allow users to interact with their wallets. These endpoints include creating a new wallet, restoring a wallet from a mnemonic, listing available wallets, getting a wallet's status, locking and unlocking a wallet, deleting a wallet, getting the total balance of a wallet, transferring ALPH from a wallet, signing data, sweeping all unlocked ALPH from all addresses to another address, listing all addresses of a wallet, getting an address's info, deriving the next address, choosing the active address, revealing the mnemonic, and listing all miner addresses per group and deriving the next miner addresses for each group.

Each endpoint is defined as a `BaseEndpoint` object, which specifies the input and output types of the endpoint. For example, the `createWallet` endpoint takes a `WalletCreation` object as input and returns a `WalletCreationResult` object as output. The input and output types are defined using case classes that represent the JSON objects that are sent and received by the endpoint.

The endpoints are organized into two main groups: `wallets` and `minerWallet`. The `wallets` group contains endpoints that are available for all wallets, while the `minerWallet` group contains endpoints that are only available for wallets that were created with the `isMiner = true` flag.

Overall, this code provides a convenient and type-safe way for users to interact with their wallets in the Alephium project. By defining the endpoints using Tapir, the code ensures that the input and output types are well-defined and that the endpoints are easy to compose and reuse.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines endpoints for a wallet API in the Alephium project.

2. What libraries or frameworks are being used in this code?
- This code is using the sttp.tapir library for defining endpoints and TapirCodecs and TapirSchemasLike for encoding and decoding data. It is also using various other libraries from the Alephium project.

3. What are some of the available endpoints in this API?
- Some of the available endpoints in this API include creating and restoring wallets, listing available wallets, getting wallet status and balances, transferring ALPH, signing data, sweeping addresses, and deriving new addresses. There are also endpoints specific to miner wallets, such as listing miner addresses and deriving new miner addresses.
