This file defines a `WalletServer` class and an `object` that converts `WalletError` to `ApiError`. The `WalletServer` class extends `WalletEndpointsLogic` and `WalletDocumentation` and uses `VertxFutureServerInterpreter` to define routes for various wallet-related operations. 

The `WalletServer` class takes in a `WalletService` instance, a `Duration` object, and an optional `ApiKey` object. It also takes in an implicit `GroupConfig` object and an `ExecutionContext`. The `WalletEndpointsLogic` trait defines methods for various wallet operations, and the `WalletDocumentation` trait provides documentation for these methods. The `VertxFutureServerInterpreter` trait provides methods to convert the defined routes to Vert.x `Route` objects.

The `WalletServer` class defines a `routes` `AVector` that maps each defined method to a `Route` object using the `route` method provided by `VertxFutureServerInterpreter`. It also defines a `docsRoute` that provides Swagger UI documentation for the defined routes.

The `WalletServer` class is used to define the wallet-related routes for the Alephium project. The `WalletError` to `ApiError` conversion provided by the `WalletServer` object is used to convert wallet-related errors to API errors that can be returned to the user. 

Example usage:
```scala
val walletService = new WalletService()
val blockflowFetchMaxAge = Duration.ofMinutes(5)
val maybeApiKey = Some(ApiKey("myApiKey"))
implicit val groupConfig = GroupConfig()
implicit val executionContext = ExecutionContext.global

val walletServer = new WalletServer(walletService, blockflowFetchMaxAge, maybeApiKey)

// Use the defined routes to handle wallet-related requests
val router = Router.router(vertx)
walletServer.routes.foreach(_.apply(router))
```
