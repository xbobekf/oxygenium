This code is the entry point for the Alephium wallet application. It initializes the wallet configuration, creates a new instance of the `WalletApp` class, and starts the wallet service. 

The `Main` object extends the `App` trait, which allows the code to be run as a standalone application. It also extends the `Service` trait, which provides a simple way to manage the lifecycle of the wallet service. 

The `Main` object first loads the Typesafe configuration file and extracts the `WalletConfig` object from it. The `WalletConfig` object contains various configuration parameters for the wallet, such as the network settings and the location of the wallet data directory. 

Next, the code creates a new instance of the `WalletApp` class, passing in the `WalletConfig` object. The `WalletApp` class is responsible for initializing the wallet database, connecting to the Alephium network, and providing the wallet API. 

The `Main` object then defines the `startSelfOnce` and `stopSelfOnce` methods, which are called by the `Service` trait to start and stop the wallet service. In this case, these methods simply return a successful `Future` and do not perform any actual work. 

Finally, the code registers a shutdown hook to stop the wallet service when the application is terminated. It then calls the `start` method to start the wallet service and logs any errors that occur during initialization. 

Overall, this code provides a simple way to start the Alephium wallet service and manage its lifecycle. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex wallet applications that interact with the Alephium network. 

Example usage:

```
$ sbt run
```
