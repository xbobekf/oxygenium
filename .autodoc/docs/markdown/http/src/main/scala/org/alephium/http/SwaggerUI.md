The `SwaggerUI` object is a Scala class that provides a set of server endpoints for serving a Swagger UI. Swagger UI is a tool that allows users to interact with a RESTful API by providing a web-based interface for exploring the API's endpoints and parameters. 

The `SwaggerUI` object provides a set of endpoints that serve the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI specification. The OpenAPI specification is a machine-readable format for describing RESTful APIs. The Swagger UI is generated from the OpenAPI specification and provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the API.

The `SwaggerUI` object provides four endpoints:

1. `openapiEndpoint`: This endpoint serves the OpenAPI specification as a JSON string. The OpenAPI specification is generated by the application and passed to the `SwaggerUI` object as a parameter.

2. `redirectToSlashEndpoint`: This endpoint redirects requests to the Swagger UI to the root of the Swagger UI endpoint. This is useful for handling requests that do not include a trailing slash.

3. `swaggerInitializerJsEndpoint`: This endpoint serves the JavaScript code that initializes the Swagger UI. The JavaScript code is generated by the `SwaggerUI` object and includes the URL of the OpenAPI specification.

4. `resourcesEndpoint`: This endpoint serves the static resources required by the Swagger UI, such as CSS files and images.

The `SwaggerUI` object uses the `sttp.tapir` library to define the server endpoints. The `sttp.tapir` library provides a type-safe way to define HTTP endpoints in Scala. The `SwaggerUI` object also uses the `org.alephium.util.AVector` class to store the endpoints. The `AVector` class is a custom implementation of a vector that is optimized for small vectors.

Here is an example of how the `SwaggerUI` object can be used to serve a Swagger UI:

```scala
import org.alephium.http.SwaggerUI
import org.alephium.util.AVector

val openapiContent: String = ???
val contextPath: String = "docs"
val openapiFileName: String = "openapi.json"

val endpoints: AVector[ServerEndpoint[Any, Future]] = SwaggerUI(openapiContent, contextPath, openapiFileName)
```
