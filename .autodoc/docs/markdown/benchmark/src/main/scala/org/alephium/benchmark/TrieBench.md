The `TrieBench` class is a benchmarking tool for measuring the performance of the `SparseMerkleTrie` data structure. The `SparseMerkleTrie` is a tree-like data structure that is used to store key-value pairs in a way that allows for efficient lookups and updates. The `TrieBench` class contains two benchmarking methods: `randomInsert` and `randomInsertBatch`.

The `randomInsert` method generates a set of random key-value pairs and inserts them into a new `SparseMerkleTrie` instance. The method then prints the root hash of the trie. The purpose of this method is to measure the time it takes to insert a large number of key-value pairs into a trie.

The `randomInsertBatch` method is similar to `randomInsert`, but instead of inserting each key-value pair individually, it inserts them in a batch. This method first creates an in-memory trie, inserts the key-value pairs into it, and then persists the trie to disk. The method then prints the root hash of the trie. The purpose of this method is to measure the time it takes to insert a large number of key-value pairs into a trie using a batch insert.

The `prepareTrie` method is a helper method that creates a new `SparseMerkleTrie` instance and initializes it with a new RocksDBKeyValueStorage instance. The method returns the new trie instance.

Overall, the `TrieBench` class is a useful tool for measuring the performance of the `SparseMerkleTrie` data structure. It can be used to optimize the performance of the trie for use in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a benchmark for measuring the performance of inserting data into a Sparse Merkle Trie data structure.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the Akka library, the RocksDBKeyValueStorage library, and the Scala standard library.

3. What is the difference between the `randomInsert` and `randomInsertBatch` methods?
- The `randomInsert` method inserts data into the trie one key-value pair at a time, while the `randomInsertBatch` method inserts all the data into the trie at once and then persists it to disk. The `randomInsertBatch` method is expected to be faster than `randomInsert` because it reduces the number of disk writes.
