This file contains two Scala objects: `Version` and `Dependencies`. These objects define the versions of various libraries and dependencies used in the Alephium project. 

The `Version` object defines the versions of the following libraries: 
- Akka
- Tapir
- Sttp
- Apispec
- Prometheus

The `Dependencies` object defines the dependencies used in the project. These include:
- Akka: `akka-actor`, `akka-slf4j`, and `akka-testkit`
- Vert.x: `vertx-core`
- Upickle: `upickle`
- Ficus: `ficus`
- Bouncy Castle: `bcprov-jdk18on`
- Fastparse: `fastparse`
- Logback: `logback-classic`
- RocksDB: `rocksdbjni`
- Scala Logging: `scala-logging`
- ScalaCheck: `scalacheck`
- ScalaTest: `scalatest`
- ScalaTestPlus: `scalacheck-1-14`
- WeUPnP: `weupnp`
- Tapir: `tapir-core`, `tapir-server`, `tapir-vertx-server`, `tapir-openapi-docs`, `tapir-openapi-model`, `tapir-swagger-ui`, and `tapir-sttp-client`
- Sttp: `async-http-client-backend-future`
- Prometheus: `simpleclient`, `simpleclient_common`, and `simpleclient_hotspot`
- Scopt: `scopt`

These dependencies are used throughout the Alephium project to provide various functionality, such as networking, logging, testing, and more. For example, the `akka-actor` library is used to implement the actor model in the project, while `tapir` is used to define and document the API endpoints. 

Overall, this file serves as a central location for defining the versions and dependencies used in the Alephium project, making it easier to manage and update them as needed.
