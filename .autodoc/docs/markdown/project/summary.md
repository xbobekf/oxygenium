The `.autodoc/docs/json/project` folder contains essential files for the Alephium project, including code generation, dependency management, versioning, and code style configuration.

`Boilerplate.scala` is responsible for generating boilerplate code for serializing and deserializing case classes. It defines templates for generating source code (`GenProductSerde` and `GenProductSerializer`) and test code (`GenProductSerdeTest`). The `Boilerplate` object can be used to generate the required code as shown below:

```scala
import java.io.File
import org.alephium.serde.Boilerplate

val srcDir: File = ???
val testDir: File = ???

Boilerplate.genSrc(srcDir)
Boilerplate.genTest(testDir)
```

`Dependencies.scala` centralizes the management of library versions and dependencies used in the Alephium project. It defines the versions of libraries such as Akka, Tapir, and Prometheus, and lists the dependencies for each library. This file makes it easier to manage and update dependencies throughout the project.

`release.sh` is a script for updating the version number and creating a new git tag for the Alephium project. It automates the versioning process, ensuring that the version number is updated in the appropriate files and a new git tag is created. Example usage:

```
./update_version.sh 1.2.3
```

`scalastyle-config.xml` is a configuration file for the Scalastyle tool, which analyzes Scala code for adherence to a set of rules. This file defines the rules that the tool will use to analyze the Alephium codebase and report any violations. It includes checks for file length, class naming conventions, whitespace usage, and more. Custom checks specific to the Alephium project are also included, such as a check for the correct copyright notice in file headers. This file is an important part of maintaining code quality and consistency in the Alephium project.

In summary, the files in this folder play a crucial role in the Alephium project by automating code generation, managing dependencies, automating versioning, and ensuring code quality. These files work together to maintain a consistent, maintainable, and high-quality codebase for the Alephium project.
