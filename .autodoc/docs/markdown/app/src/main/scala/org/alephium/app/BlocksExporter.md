The `BlocksExporter` class is responsible for exporting blocks from the Alephium blockchain to a file. The class takes in a `BlockFlow` instance, which is responsible for managing the blockchain, and a `Path` instance, which represents the root directory where the exported file will be stored. The `GroupConfig` instance is also passed in implicitly.

The `export` method is the main method of the class. It takes in a filename as a parameter and returns an `IOResult` instance, which represents the result of the export operation. The method first validates the filename to ensure that it only contains alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods. If the filename is valid, the method creates a `File` instance using the root directory and filename and proceeds to fetch all the blocks from the blockchain. The blocks are then sorted by timestamp and written to the file in hexadecimal format.

The `validateFilename` method is a helper method that validates the filename using a regular expression. If the filename is valid, the method returns a `File` instance representing the file to be exported. If the filename is invalid, the method returns an `IOError` instance.

The `fetchChain` method is a helper method that fetches all the blocks from a particular chain index. The method first gets the maximum height of the chain index and then fetches all the blocks from height 0 to the maximum height. The blocks are fetched using the `fetchBlocksAt` method.

The `fetchBlocksAt` method is a helper method that fetches all the blocks at a particular height from a chain index. The method first gets all the block hashes at the specified height and then fetches the blocks using the `getBlock` method of the `BlockFlow` instance.

Overall, the `BlocksExporter` class provides a convenient way to export blocks from the Alephium blockchain to a file. The exported file can be used for various purposes such as analysis, backup, or migration.
