This code defines a CPU solo miner for the Alephium cryptocurrency. The purpose of this code is to provide a way for users to mine Alephium blocks using their CPU. 

The code first imports necessary libraries and defines the `CpuSoloMiner` object. The `CpuSoloMiner` object takes in a configuration file, an actor system, and an optional string of raw API addresses. It then creates a new `CpuSoloMiner` instance with these parameters. 

The `CpuSoloMiner` class defines a `miner` actor that is created using the `ExternalMinerMock` class. The `ExternalMinerMock` class is used to create a mock miner that can be used for testing purposes. The `miner` actor is then started with the `Miner.Start` message. 

The `parseHostAndPort` method is used to parse the raw API addresses string into a list of `InetSocketAddress` objects. This method takes in a string of raw API addresses and returns a list of `InetSocketAddress` objects. 

Overall, this code provides a way for users to mine Alephium blocks using their CPU. It does this by creating a `CpuSoloMiner` instance that uses the `ExternalMinerMock` class to create a mock miner. The `parseHostAndPort` method is used to parse the raw API addresses string into a list of `InetSocketAddress` objects.
