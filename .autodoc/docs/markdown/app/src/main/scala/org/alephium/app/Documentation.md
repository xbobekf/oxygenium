The `Documentation` trait is a part of the Alephium project and provides functionality for generating documentation for the Alephium API. It defines an `openAPI` object that represents the OpenAPI specification for the API, which can be used to generate documentation for the API.

The `Documentation` trait extends the `Endpoints` trait, which defines the endpoints for the Alephium API. The `walletEndpoints` method returns a list of endpoints related to the wallet functionality of the API. The `port` method returns the port number on which the API is running.

The `blockflowEndpoints` method returns a list of endpoints related to the blockflow functionality of the API. These endpoints are combined with the `walletEndpoints` to generate the complete list of endpoints for the API.

The `servers` method returns a list of servers that can be used to access the API. The first server is a relative path to the API, while the second server is a template that can be used to generate URLs for the API.

The `openAPI` object is generated using the `toOpenAPI` method from the `OpenAPIDocsInterpreter` trait. This method takes a list of endpoints, the title of the API, and the version of the API as parameters, and returns an `OpenAPI` object that represents the OpenAPI specification for the API. The `openAPI` object is then modified to include the servers that were generated earlier.

Overall, the `Documentation` trait provides a convenient way to generate documentation for the Alephium API using the OpenAPI specification. It defines the endpoints for the API, generates the OpenAPI specification, and includes information about the servers that can be used to access the API.
## Questions:
