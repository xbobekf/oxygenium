This file contains a package object for the Alephium project, which defines two utility functions and a type alias. The `FutureTry` type alias is defined as a `Future` of a `Try`, which is a common pattern in Scala for handling asynchronous operations that may fail. 

The `wrapCompilerResult` function takes an `Either` of a `Compiler.Error` or a value of type `T`, and returns a `Try` of type `T`. If the input is a `Left` containing a `Compiler.Error`, the function maps the error message to a `badRequest` response using the `org.alephium.api` package. Otherwise, it returns a `Success` containing the value of type `T`. This function is likely used to handle errors that may occur during compilation of code in the Alephium project.

The `wrapError` function takes an `Either` of a `String` or a value of type `T`, and returns a `Try` of type `T`. If the input is a `Left` containing a `String`, the function maps the string to a `badRequest` response using the `org.alephium.api` package. Otherwise, it returns a `Success` containing the value of type `T`. This function is likely used to handle errors that may occur during various operations in the Alephium project.

Overall, this package object provides some useful utility functions for handling errors in the Alephium project, particularly in the context of asynchronous operations. The `FutureTry` type alias is likely used throughout the project to simplify the handling of asynchronous operations that may fail. The `wrapCompilerResult` and `wrapError` functions are likely used in various parts of the project to handle errors that may occur during compilation or other operations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   This code file contains the license and a package object for the Alephium project.

2. What is the significance of the `FutureTry` type alias?
   The `FutureTry` type alias is a shorthand for a `Future` that returns a `Try` object, which is a container for a computation that may either result in an exception or return a value.

3. What do the `wrapCompilerResult` and `wrapError` functions do?
   The `wrapCompilerResult` function takes an `Either` object that contains either a `Compiler.Error` or a value of type `T`, and returns a `Try` object that contains either a `badRequest` error or the value of type `T`. The `wrapError` function takes an `Either` object that contains either a `String` error message or a value of type `T`, and returns a `Try` object that contains either a `badRequest` error or the value of type `T`.
