This code is part of the Alephium project and contains a test suite for smart contracts, specifically for a token swap contract. The test suite is implemented as a class `SmartContractTest` that extends `AlephiumActorSpec`. The test suite uses a `SwapContractsFixture` to set up the environment for testing, including starting a clique of nodes, creating and deploying contracts, and executing scripts.

The `SwapContracts` object contains the source code for a token contract and a swap contract, as well as helper functions to generate transaction scripts for various operations like adding liquidity, swapping tokens for ALPH (the native currency), and swapping ALPH for tokens.

The test suite contains several test cases that cover different aspects of the smart contracts:

1. Compiling and deploying the token and swap contracts.
2. Transferring tokens between addresses.
3. Adding liquidity to the swap contract.
4. Swapping tokens for ALPH and vice versa.
5. Estimating gas costs for contract deployment and script execution.

The test suite also checks the state of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) after each operation to ensure that the expected changes in balances and tokens have occurred.

Here's an example of how a token contract is created and deployed:

```scala
val tokenContractBuildResult =
  contract(
    SwapContracts.tokenContract,
    gas = Some(100000),
    initialImmFields = None,
    initialMutFields = None,
    issueTokenAmount = Some(1024)
  )
```

And here's an example of how a script is executed to swap ALPH for tokens:

```scala
script(
  SwapContracts.swapAlphForTokenTxScript(address, swapContractKey, ALPH.alph(100)),
  attoAlphAmount = Some(Amount(ALPH.alph(100) + dustUtxoAmount))
)
```
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SwapContracts` object and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `SwapContracts` object contains the code for a simple token and swap contract, as well as methods to generate transaction scripts for various operations like token withdrawal, adding liquidity, and swapping tokens with ALPH. These methods are used in the `SmartContractTest` class to test the functionality of the contracts.

2. **Question**: How does the `SmartContractTest` class test the functionality of the contracts?
   **Answer**: The `SmartContractTest` class tests the functionality of the contracts by creating instances of the contracts, executing various operations like token withdrawal, adding liquidity, and swapping tokens with ALPH, and then checking the resulting UTXOs and balances to ensure the expected outcomes.

3. **Question**: What are the different fixtures used in the `SmartContractTest` class, and what is their purpose?
   **Answer**: The `SmartContractTest` class uses two fixtures: `CliqueFixture` and `SwapContractsFixture`. `CliqueFixture` sets up a test environment with a single or multiple nodes, while `SwapContractsFixture` extends `CliqueFixture` and provides additional methods for testing the swap contracts, such as creating contracts, submitting transactions, and checking UTXOs.
