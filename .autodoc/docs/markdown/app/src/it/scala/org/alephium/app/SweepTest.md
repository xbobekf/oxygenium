This code defines a set of tests for sweeping funds from Alephium wallets. The tests are defined in the `SweepTest` abstract class, which is then extended by two concrete classes: `SweepMiner` and `SweepNoneMiner`. These classes differ only in the number of addresses they use for testing, with `SweepMiner` using four addresses and `SweepNoneMiner` using only one.

The tests themselves are defined using the `it should` syntax from the ScalaTest testing framework. The first test checks that funds can be swept from the active address of a wallet, leaving all other addresses untouched. The second test checks that funds can be swept from all addresses in a wallet.

Each test is defined within a `SweepFixture` trait, which provides a set of helper methods and variables for setting up the test environment. These include creating a new Clique network with a single node, creating a new wallet with the specified number of addresses, and sending funds to each address in the wallet.

The tests themselves use the Alephium API to perform the sweeping operations and check the resulting balances. The tests are designed to be run as part of a larger test suite for the Alephium project.

Overall, this code provides a set of tests for ensuring that funds can be swept from Alephium wallets, which is an important feature for managing wallet balances. The tests are designed to be run in a test environment and are not intended for use in production code.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SweepTest` class and its subclasses `SweepMiner` and `SweepNoneMiner`?
- The `SweepTest` class is an abstract class that defines tests for sweeping amounts from addresses in a wallet. Its subclasses `SweepMiner` and `SweepNoneMiner` implement these tests for different scenarios, with `SweepMiner` assuming that the wallet belongs to a miner and `SweepNoneMiner` assuming that it does not.

2. What is the `SweepFixture` trait and what does it do?
- The `SweepFixture` trait is a trait that defines a set of variables and methods that are used by the tests in the `SweepTest` class. It sets up a test environment with a single node running the Alephium protocol, creates a wallet with a specified number of addresses, and sends transfers to those addresses.

3. What is the purpose of the `request` method and where is it defined?
- The `request` method is used to send HTTP requests to the Alephium node's REST API and receive the corresponding responses. It is defined in the `org.alephium.util` package, which is imported at the beginning of the file.
