This code is a docker-compose file that defines the services and configurations needed to run the Alephium blockchain explorer. The Alephium blockchain explorer is a tool that allows users to view and analyze data on the Alephium blockchain network. 

The docker-compose file defines three services: postgres, explorer-backend, and explorer. 

The postgres service is a PostgreSQL database that stores data related to the Alephium blockchain. The volumes section defines a named volume called postgres-data that is used to persist the data stored in the database. The environment section sets the username, password, and database name for the PostgreSQL instance. 

The explorer-backend service is the backend component of the Alephium blockchain explorer. It is responsible for retrieving data from the Alephium blockchain and storing it in the PostgreSQL database. The image section specifies the Docker image to use for this service. The ports section maps port 9090 on the host machine to port 9090 in the container. The environment section sets the hostnames for the PostgreSQL database, the Alephium blockchain node, and the explorer-backend service itself. The depends_on section specifies that this service depends on the postgres and alephium services. 

The explorer service is the frontend component of the Alephium blockchain explorer. It is responsible for displaying data from the PostgreSQL database to the user. The image section specifies the Docker image to use for this service. The ports section maps port 3001 on the host machine to port 3000 in the container. The depends_on section specifies that this service depends on the explorer-backend service. 

Overall, this docker-compose file defines the necessary components to run the Alephium blockchain explorer. By running this file, users can access the explorer frontend through their web browser and view data on the Alephium blockchain network. 

Example usage: 

To start the Alephium blockchain explorer, navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose file and run the following command: 

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start all three services defined in the docker-compose file. Once the services are running, users can access the explorer frontend by navigating to http://localhost:3001 in their web browser.
