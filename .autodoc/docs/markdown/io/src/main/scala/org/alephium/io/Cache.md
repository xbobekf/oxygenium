This file contains code for a cache implementation used in the Alephium project. The cache is defined as a sealed trait, which means that it can only be extended within the same file. The cache has three possible states: Cached, Modified, and Removed. 

The Cached state represents a value that has been retrieved from the cache and exists in the underlying data structure. The Modified state represents a value that has been inserted, updated, or removed from the cache. The Inserted state represents a value that has been added to the cache, the Removed state represents a value that has been removed from the cache, and the Updated state represents a value that has been updated in the cache. 

Each state has its own properties. The Cached state extends the Cache trait and the KeyExistedInUnderlying and ValueExists traits. The KeyExistedInUnderlying trait indicates that the key exists in the underlying data structure, and the ValueExists trait provides access to the value. The Modified state extends the Cache trait and either the ValueExists or KeyExistedInUnderlying trait, depending on the type of modification. 

This cache implementation can be used to store and retrieve data in the Alephium project. For example, it could be used to cache frequently accessed data to improve performance. The cache could be implemented using a variety of data structures, such as a hash table or a binary search tree, depending on the specific needs of the project. 

Here is an example of how the cache could be used in the Alephium project:

```
val cache = new Cache[String]()
val key = "example_key"
val value = "example_value"

// Insert a value into the cache
val inserted = Inserted(value)
cache.put(key, inserted)

// Retrieve a value from the cache
val cached = cache.get(key)
cached match {
  case Cached(v) => println(s"Value found: $v")
  case _ => println("Value not found")
}

// Update a value in the cache
val updated = Updated("new_value")
cache.put(key, updated)

// Remove a value from the cache
val removed = Removed[String]()
cache.put(key, removed)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Cache` trait and its subtypes?
   - The `Cache` trait and its subtypes define different types of cache operations and their results.
2. What is the significance of the `KeyExistedInUnderlying` trait?
   - The `KeyExistedInUnderlying` trait is used to indicate that a cache operation was performed on a key that already existed in the underlying data structure.
3. How are the `Modified` and `ValueExists` traits related?
   - The `Modified` trait is a parent trait of `Inserted`, `Removed`, and `Updated`, and the `ValueExists` trait is a parent trait of `Cached`, `Inserted`, and `Updated`. This means that `Inserted` and `Updated` cache operations have a value associated with them, while `Removed` and `Cached` operations do not.
