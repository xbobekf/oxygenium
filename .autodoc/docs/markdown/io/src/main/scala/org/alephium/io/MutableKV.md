This file contains code for a trait called MutableKV, which is used to define a mutable key-value store. The trait extends another trait called ReadableKV, which provides read-only access to the key-value store. MutableKV adds two methods to ReadableKV: remove and put. These methods allow for the removal and addition of key-value pairs to the store.

The trait is generic, with three type parameters: K, V, and T. K represents the type of the keys in the store, V represents the type of the values, and T represents the type of the transaction used to modify the store. The remove and put methods both return an IOResult[T], which represents the result of the transaction. The unit method returns a T, which is used to represent a successful transaction with no side effects.

The object MutableKV contains another trait called WithInitialValue, which extends MutableKV and adds a method called getInitialValue. This method returns an IOResult[Option[V]], which represents the initial value of a key in the store. This trait is used when creating a new key-value store with initial values.

Overall, this code provides a foundation for creating a mutable key-value store that can be modified through transactions. It can be used in the larger project to store and modify data in a persistent and efficient manner. Here is an example of how this trait might be used:

```scala
class MyKVStore extends MutableKV[String, Int, MyTransaction] with MutableKV.WithInitialValue[String, Int, MyTransaction] {
  def remove(key: String): IOResult[MyTransaction] = {
    // implementation
  }

  def put(key: String, value: Int): IOResult[MyTransaction] = {
    // implementation
  }

  def get(key: String): IOResult[Option[Int]] = {
    // implementation
  }

  def getInitialValue(key: String): IOResult[Option[Int]] = {
    // implementation
  }

  def unit: MyTransaction = {
    // implementation
  }
}
```

This example defines a new key-value store that uses strings as keys, integers as values, and a custom transaction type called MyTransaction. It implements the remove, put, get, getInitialValue, and unit methods required by the MutableKV and MutableKV.WithInitialValue traits. The implementation of these methods would depend on the specific requirements of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MutableKV` trait and what does it do?
   - The `MutableKV` trait is a key-value store interface that allows for removing and putting key-value pairs, and has a unit value. It extends the `ReadableKV` trait which provides read-only access to the key-value store.
   
2. What is the purpose of the `MutableKV.WithInitialValue` trait and how does it relate to `MutableKV`?
   - The `MutableKV.WithInitialValue` trait is a sub-trait of `MutableKV` that provides an additional method to get the initial value of a key. It requires `Self` to be a `MutableKV` instance.
