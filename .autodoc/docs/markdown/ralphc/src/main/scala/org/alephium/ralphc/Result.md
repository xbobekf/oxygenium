This file contains two case classes, `ScriptResult` and `ContractResult`, along with their respective companion objects. These classes are used to represent the results of compiling Oxygenium smart contracts and scripts.

`ScriptResult` contains information about a compiled script, including its version, name, bytecode template, and function signatures. The `from` method in the companion object is used to convert a `CompileScriptResult` object (which is returned by the Oxygenium API when a script is compiled) into a `ScriptResult` object.

`ContractResult` contains similar information about a compiled contract, but also includes the bytecode of the contract and its code hash. Additionally, it includes information about the contract's events. The `from` method in the companion object is used to convert a `CompileContractResult` object (which is returned by the Oxygenium API when a contract is compiled) into a `ContractResult` object.

These classes are likely used throughout the Oxygenium project to represent the results of compiling smart contracts and scripts. For example, they may be used by other parts of the project to verify that a contract or script has been compiled correctly, or to extract information about a compiled contract or script. Here is an example of how `ScriptResult` might be used:

```
import org.oxygenium.api.OxygeniumAPI

val api = new OxygeniumAPI()
val script = "def main():\n  return 42"
val result = api.compileScript(script)
val scriptResult = ScriptResult.from(result)
println(scriptResult.version) // prints the version of the compiled script
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines two case classes, `ScriptResult` and `ContractResult`, which are used to represent the results of compiling Oxygenium smart contracts and scripts.

2. What other files or packages does this code depend on?
   - This code depends on several other packages, including `org.oxygenium.api.model`, `org.oxygenium.protocol`, and `org.oxygenium.util`. It also imports the `Hash` class from `org.oxygenium.protocol`.

3. What is the license for this code and where can I find more information about it?
