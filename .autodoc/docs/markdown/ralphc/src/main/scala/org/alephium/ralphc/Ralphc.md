This code is a part of the Alephium project and is responsible for running the Ralphc application. The Ralphc application is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to interact with the Alephium blockchain. 

The code begins by defining the GNU Lesser General Public License under which the Alephium project is distributed. It then imports the `org.alephium.ralphc` package and defines an object called `Main`. 

The `Main` object extends the `App` trait, which allows it to be run as a standalone application. The `Main` object contains a `try` block that attempts to call the `Cli()` method with the `args` parameter. The `Cli()` method is responsible for parsing the command-line arguments and executing the appropriate action. The `call()` method is called on the `Cli()` object, which returns an exit code that is passed to the `System.exit()` method. 

If an exception is thrown during the execution of the `try` block, the `catch` block is executed. The `catch` block prints the exception message to the console and exits the application with an exit code of -1. 

Overall, this code is responsible for running the Ralphc application and handling any exceptions that may occur during its execution. It is a crucial component of the Alephium project as it allows users to interact with the blockchain through a command-line interface. 

Example usage:

```
$ ralphc --help
Usage: ralphc [options]

  -h, --help   prints this usage text
