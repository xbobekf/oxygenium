This file contains the implementation of a compiler for the Alephium project. The `Compiler` class is responsible for compiling contracts and scripts written in the Alephium language. The `compileProject` method is the main entry point for the compiler. It takes no arguments and returns an `Either` type, which can be either a `String` error message or a `CompileProjectResult` object.

The `Compiler` class has a constructor that takes a `Config` object as an argument. The `Config` object contains the paths to the source code and the output artifacts. The `compileProject` method first calls the `analysisCodes` method to analyze the source code and generate metadata for each contract and script. The `analysisCodes` method reads the source code from the source files, computes the hash of the source code, and generates metadata for each contract and script. The metadata includes the name of the contract or script, the path to the artifact file, and the hash of the source code.

The `compileProject` method then calls the `ralph.Compiler.compileProject` method to compile the source code. The `ralph.Compiler.compileProject` method returns a tuple of two lists: a list of `CompileContractResult` objects and a list of `CompileScriptResult` objects. The `compileProject` method then iterates over the `CompileContractResult` objects and the `CompileScriptResult` objects, updates the metadata for each contract and script with the warnings and bytecode debug patch, and writes the artifact files to disk. Finally, the `compileProject` method writes the project metadata to a `.project.json` file and returns a `CompileProjectResult` object.

The `Codec` object defines the serialization and deserialization methods for the Alephium API model classes. The `Codec` object uses the `upickle` library to generate the serialization and deserialization code automatically.

The `Compiler` object contains two utility methods: `writer` and `getSourceFiles`. The `writer` method writes an object to a file using the `upickle` library. The `getSourceFiles` method recursively searches a directory for files with a given extension and returns a list of paths to the matching files. The `deleteFile` method is not used in this file.

Example usage:

```scala
val config = Config(
  Paths.get("/path/to/source/code"),
  Paths.get("/path/to/output/artifacts"),
  CompilerOptions()
)
val compiler = Compiler(config)
compiler.compileProject() match {
  case Left(error) => println(s"Error: $error")
  case Right(result) => println(s"Result: $result")
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a compiler for Alephium smart contracts written in the `.ral` language. It compiles the contracts and generates artifacts in JSON format.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including `scala`, `org.alephium`, `java`, and `scala.util`. It also imports several classes and objects from other files in the `alephium` project.

3. What is the output of this code and where is it stored?
- The output of this code is a set of JSON artifacts generated from the compiled smart contracts. These artifacts are stored in a specified directory, which is passed as an argument to the `Compiler` class.
