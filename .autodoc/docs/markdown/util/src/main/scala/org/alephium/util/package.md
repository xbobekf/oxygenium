The code provided is a Scala file that defines a utility function called `discard`. This function is defined in the `org.alephium.util` package object, which means it can be used throughout the entire `alephium` project.

The purpose of the `discard` function is to evaluate an expression for its side effects only, and discard its result. This is useful in cases where an expression needs to be evaluated for its side effects, but its result is not needed. By discarding the result, the code can avoid warnings about unused values.

The `discard` function takes a single argument of type `E`, which is a generic type parameter. This means that the function can be used with any type of expression. The function is annotated with `@inline` and `@specialized`, which are performance optimizations that can improve the speed of the code.

The implementation of the `discard` function is simple. It first evaluates the expression passed as an argument, and assigns the result to a variable named `_`. The underscore is used to indicate that the value is not needed. The function then returns `Unit`, which is a type that represents the absence of a value. This is done to prevent warnings about discarding a value.

Here is an example of how the `discard` function can be used:

```
val x = 42
val y = discard(x + 1)
```

In this example, the `discard` function is used to evaluate the expression `x + 1` for its side effects only. The result of the expression is discarded, and the value of `y` is set to `Unit`.

Overall, the `discard` function is a simple utility function that can be used to avoid warnings about unused values in Scala code. It is a small but useful part of the `alephium` project's utility library.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a function called `discard` in the `util` package of the `alephium` project, which discards the result of an expression and returns `Unit`.

2. What is the license for this code?
   - This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.

3. Why is the `discard` function annotated with `@inline` and `@specialized`?
   - The `@inline` annotation suggests that the function should be inlined by the compiler for performance reasons, while the `@specialized` annotation suggests that the function should be specialized for a specific type to avoid boxing and unboxing overhead.
