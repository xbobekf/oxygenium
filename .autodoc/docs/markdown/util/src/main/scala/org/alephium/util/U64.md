The `U64` class and its companion object in the `org.alephium.util` package provide a set of operations for unsigned 64-bit integers. The class is implemented as a value class, which means that it is optimized for performance and memory usage. The class extends `AnyVal` and implements the `Ordered` trait, which allows instances of `U64` to be compared with each other.

The `U64` class provides methods for performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo. These methods are implemented in two versions: a safe version that returns an `Option[U64]` and a corresponding unsafe version that returns a `U64`. The safe version returns `None` if the operation would result in an overflow or division by zero, while the unsafe version assumes that the operation is safe and returns the result directly.

The `U64` class also provides methods for converting between `U64` and other integer types such as `I64`, `I256`, `U256`, and `BigInteger`. These methods return an `Option[U64]` and return `None` if the input value is negative or too large to fit in a 64-bit unsigned integer.

The companion object provides constants for common values such as zero, one, and maximum value. It also provides constants for large numbers such as one million and one billion. These constants are implemented as `U64` instances and can be used in arithmetic operations.

Overall, the `U64` class and its companion object provide a convenient and efficient way to work with unsigned 64-bit integers in the Alephium project. The class is designed to be easy to use and provides both safe and unsafe versions of arithmetic operations to suit different needs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `U64` class and how is it used in the `alephium` project?
- The `U64` class represents an unsigned 64-bit integer and is used for arithmetic operations in the `alephium` project.
2. What is the difference between the `addUnsafe` and `add` methods in the `U64` class?
- The `addUnsafe` method performs addition without checking for overflow, while the `add` method returns an `Option` that is `Some` if the addition does not overflow and `None` otherwise.
3. What is the purpose of the `modulus` variable in the `U64` object?
- The `modulus` variable is a `BigInteger` that represents 2^64, which is used for converting negative `Long` values to their corresponding positive `BigInteger` values in the `toBigInt` method of the `U64` class.
