This file contains the implementation of a data structure called Forest, which is used to represent a collection of trees. The Forest is implemented as a collection of root nodes, each of which represents the root of a tree. Each node in the tree has a key and a value, where the key is used to identify the node and the value is the data associated with the node.

The Forest is implemented as a Scala class, with a companion object that provides factory methods for creating new Forest instances. The Forest class provides methods for adding and removing nodes from the Forest, as well as methods for querying the Forest to determine if it contains a particular node.

The Forest is designed to be used in the context of the Alephium project, which is a blockchain platform. The Forest is used to represent the blockchain as a collection of trees, where each tree represents a fork in the blockchain. The key of each node in the tree is the hash of the block that the node represents, and the value is the block data.

The Forest is implemented using a mutable data structure, which allows for efficient updates to the Forest as new blocks are added to the blockchain. The Forest is also designed to be simple and easy to use, with a small number of methods that provide the basic functionality needed to work with the Forest.

The Forest is implemented using Scala collections, which provides a rich set of methods for working with the Forest. The Forest is also designed to be extensible, with the ability to add new methods and functionality as needed.

Example usage:

```
val forest = Forest.build(block, _.hash)
forest.contains(block.hash)
forest.removeRootNode(block.hash)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Forest` class and its associated `Node` class?
- The `Forest` class represents a forest data structure, which is a collection of trees. The `Node` class represents a node in a tree, with a key and a value.

2. What is the purpose of the `tryBuild` method in the `Forest` object?
- The `tryBuild` method attempts to construct a forest from a collection of values, where each value has a key and a parent key. If the collection of values cannot be constructed into a valid forest, `None` is returned.

3. Why does the `Forest` class use `mutable.ArrayBuffer` instead of `Set`?
- The `Forest` class uses `mutable.ArrayBuffer` instead of `Set` because the number of forks in a blockchain is usually small, and `ArrayBuffer` provides better performance for small collections.
