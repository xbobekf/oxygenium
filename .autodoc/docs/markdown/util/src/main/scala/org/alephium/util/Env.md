This code defines an enumeration called `Env` and an object called `Env` that contains methods for resolving the current environment and executing code only in the production environment. 

The `Env` enumeration defines four possible environments: `Prod`, `Debug`, `Test`, and `Integration`. Each environment has a `name` property that returns a string representation of the environment. 

The `Env` object contains a `currentEnv` property that resolves the current environment based on the value of the `ALEPHIUM_ENV` environment variable. If the variable is not set, the default environment is `Prod`. 

The `resolve` method takes an optional `env` parameter and returns the corresponding `Env` value based on the input string. If the input string does not match any of the defined environments, the default environment is `Prod`. 

The `forProd` method takes a block of code as a parameter and executes it only if the current environment is `Prod`. Otherwise, it does nothing. This method can be used to ensure that certain code is only executed in the production environment and not in development or testing environments. 

Overall, this code provides a simple way to manage different environments in a project and execute code selectively based on the current environment. For example, in a web application, different database configurations or API keys could be used depending on the environment. The `Env` object can be used to determine the current environment and the `forProd` method can be used to ensure that sensitive code is only executed in the production environment. 

Example usage:

```
// execute code only in production environment
Env.forProd {
  // code to execute in production environment
}

// get the name of the current environment
val envName = Env.currentEnv.name
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an enumeration of environment types and provides a way to resolve the current environment based on a system environment variable.

2. What license is this code released under?
- This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.

3. How can a developer use this code in their project?
- A developer can import the `org.alephium.util.Env` object and use the `currentEnv` or `resolve` methods to determine the current environment or resolve a specific environment, respectively. They can also use the `forProd` method to execute a block of code only if the current environment is production.
