This code is a configuration file for the logging system used in the Alephium project. The purpose of this code is to define the format and destination of log messages generated by the project. 

The code defines three different appenders: ERRFILE, INFOFILE, and CONSOLE. ERRFILE and INFOFILE are both instances of the RollingFileAppender class, which writes log messages to a file. The file paths are specified using environment variables, falling back to a default location if the variables are not set. The appenders use a pattern defined in the defaultPattern property to format the log messages. The pattern includes the date, thread ID, log level, logger name, and message. The appenders also use a FixedWindowRollingPolicy to rotate log files and a SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy to limit the size of each file. 

The CONSOLE appender writes log messages to the console. It uses the same pattern as the file appenders and filters messages based on the ALEPHIUM_CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL environment variable. 

The code also sets the log level for the io.netty logger to WARN, which means that only messages with a log level of WARN or higher will be logged for that logger. 

Finally, the code defines a root logger that includes all three appenders. This means that all log messages generated by the project will be sent to all three destinations: the console, the error log file, and the info log file. 

This code is important for the Alephium project because it allows developers to easily configure the logging system to meet their needs. By changing the environment variables or the log level filters, developers can control which messages are logged and where they are logged. For example, during development, a developer might set the console log level to DEBUG to see more detailed messages, while during production, they might set it to INFO to reduce noise. 

Example usage:

To change the console log level to DEBUG, set the ALEPHIUM_CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL environment variable to DEBUG:

```
export ALEPHIUM_CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

To change the error log file location, set the ALEPHIUM_HOME environment variable:

```
export ALEPHIUM_HOME=/var/log/alephium
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a configuration file for logging in the Alephium project, specifying the log format, log levels, and log file locations for different appenders.

2. What logging libraries or frameworks are being used in this code?
   - This code is using the Logback logging framework, specifically the `ch.qos.logback` package.

3. What is the significance of the different appenders defined in this code?
   - The different appenders (`ERRFILE`, `INFOFILE`, and `CONSOLE`) specify different destinations for log output (file vs console) and different log levels. The `ERRFILE` appender logs warnings and errors to a rolling file, the `INFOFILE` appender logs messages of a specified level to a rolling file, and the `CONSOLE` appender logs messages of a specified level to the console.
