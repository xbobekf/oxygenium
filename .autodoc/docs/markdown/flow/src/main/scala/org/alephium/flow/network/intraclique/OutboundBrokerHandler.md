This file contains the implementation of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class, which is responsible for handling outbound connections to other brokers in the Alephium network. 

The `OutboundBrokerHandler` class extends the `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler` class and implements the `BrokerHandler` trait. It takes in several parameters, including the `selfCliqueInfo`, `remoteAddress`, `blockflow`, `allHandlers`, `cliqueManager`, and `blockFlowSynchronizer`. These parameters are used to initialize the class and provide it with the necessary information to handle outbound connections.

The `OutboundBrokerHandler` class also contains a companion object with a `props` method that creates a new instance of the class with the given parameters. This method is used to create new instances of the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class throughout the Alephium project.

Overall, the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class is an important component of the Alephium network, as it is responsible for handling outbound connections to other brokers. By implementing the `BrokerHandler` trait and extending the `BaseOutboundBrokerHandler` class, the `OutboundBrokerHandler` class provides a standardized way of handling outbound connections that can be used throughout the Alephium project. 

Example usage:

```scala
val outboundBrokerHandler = OutboundBrokerHandler.props(
  selfCliqueInfo,
  remoteBroker,
  blockflow,
  allHandlers,
  cliqueManager,
  blockFlowSynchronizer
)
val outboundBroker = system.actorOf(outboundBrokerHandler)
```
