This file contains code for the BlockFetcher trait and an object with a constant value. The BlockFetcher trait is used to define the behavior of an actor that fetches blocks from the network. It is imported by other classes in the project that need to fetch blocks. 

The BlockFetcher trait has four abstract methods: networkSetting, brokerConfig, blockflow, and handleBlockAnnouncement. The networkSetting method returns the network settings for the project, brokerConfig returns the broker configuration, and blockflow returns the block flow for the project. The handleBlockAnnouncement method is used to handle block announcements. 

The BlockFetcher trait also has a constant value called MaxDownloadTimes, which is set to 2. This value is used to limit the number of times a block can be downloaded. 

The object in this file contains license information for the project. 

Overall, this file is an important part of the project's block fetching functionality. It defines the behavior of an actor that fetches blocks from the network and is used by other classes in the project that need to fetch blocks. The MaxDownloadTimes constant is used to limit the number of times a block can be downloaded, which helps to prevent excessive network traffic.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines a trait and an object related to block fetching in the Alephium project.

2. What is the significance of the `MaxDownloadTimes` value?
   - The `MaxDownloadTimes` value is a constant defined in the `BlockFetcher` object and represents the maximum number of times a block can be downloaded before it is considered expired.

3. What is the `maxCapacity` value and how is it used?
   - The `maxCapacity` value is a property defined in the `BlockFetcher` trait and represents the maximum number of block hashes that can be stored in the `fetching` object. It is used to initialize the `FetchState` object with the appropriate capacity.
