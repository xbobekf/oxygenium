[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/flow/src/main/scala/org/alephium/flow/network/intraclique/InboundBrokerHandler.scala)

This code defines the `InboundBrokerHandler` class and its associated `props` method. The `InboundBrokerHandler` is responsible for handling incoming broker connections within the Alephium network. 

The `props` method takes in several parameters, including the `selfCliqueInfo` of the node, the `remoteAddress` of the incoming connection, and various actor references. It returns a `Props` object that can be used to create a new instance of the `InboundBrokerHandler`.

The `InboundBrokerHandler` class extends the `BaseInboundBrokerHandler` class and implements the `BrokerHandler` trait. It also takes in several parameters in its constructor, including the `selfCliqueInfo`, `remoteAddress`, and actor references. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the Alephium network's ability to handle incoming broker connections. It provides a way for nodes to communicate with each other and exchange information about the network. The `InboundBrokerHandler` class can be used in conjunction with other classes and methods to create a robust and reliable network for the Alephium project. 

Example usage:

```scala
val selfCliqueInfo = CliqueInfo(...)
val remoteAddress = InetSocketAddress(...)
val connection = ActorRefT[Tcp.Command](...)
val blockflow = BlockFlow(...)
val allHandlers = AllHandlers(...)
val cliqueManager = ActorRefT[CliqueManager.Command](...)
val blockFlowSynchronizer = ActorRefT[BlockFlowSynchronizer.Command](...)
implicit val brokerConfig = BrokerConfig(...)
implicit val networkSetting = NetworkSetting(...)

val props = InboundBrokerHandler.props(
  selfCliqueInfo,
  remoteAddress,
  connection,
  blockflow,
  allHandlers,
  cliqueManager,
  blockFlowSynchronizer
)

val inboundBrokerHandler = system.actorOf(props)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file defines the `InboundBrokerHandler` class and its `props` method, which are used for handling incoming broker connections in the Alephium network.

2. What other classes or libraries does this code file depend on?
    
    This code file depends on several other classes and libraries, including `akka.actor.Props`, `akka.io.Tcp`, `org.alephium.flow.core.BlockFlow`, `org.alephium.flow.handler.AllHandlers`, `org.alephium.flow.network.CliqueManager`, `org.alephium.flow.network.broker.InboundBrokerHandler`, `org.alephium.flow.network.sync.BlockFlowSynchronizer`, `org.alephium.flow.setting.NetworkSetting`, `org.alephium.protocol.config.BrokerConfig`, `org.alephium.protocol.model.CliqueInfo`, and `org.alephium.util.ActorRefT`.

3. What is the relationship between `InboundBrokerHandler` and `BaseInboundBrokerHandler`?
    
    `InboundBrokerHandler` extends `BaseInboundBrokerHandler` and adds additional functionality specific to the Alephium network, such as handling incoming broker connections and synchronizing block flows.
