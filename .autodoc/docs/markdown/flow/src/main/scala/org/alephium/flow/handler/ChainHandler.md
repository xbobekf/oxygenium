This file contains the implementation of the `ChainHandler` class and its related objects. The `ChainHandler` class is an abstract class that provides a common interface for handling different types of data that flow through the Alephium blockchain. It is designed to be extended by concrete classes that handle specific types of data. 

The `ChainHandler` class defines a set of methods that must be implemented by its concrete subclasses. These methods include `validateWithSideEffect`, `addDataToBlockFlow`, `notifyBroker`, `dataAddingFailed`, `dataInvalid`, `show`, and `measure`. 

The `ChainHandler` class also defines a set of metrics that are used to track the performance of the blockchain. These metrics include counters for the number of chain validation failures and the total number of chain validations, as well as histograms for the duration of chain validations and block durations. 

The `ChainHandler` class is designed to be used in conjunction with other classes in the Alephium blockchain project, such as `BlockFlow`, `BlockHeaderChain`, and `DependencyHandler`. Concrete subclasses of `ChainHandler` are responsible for implementing the logic for handling specific types of data, such as blocks or headers. 

Overall, the `ChainHandler` class provides a flexible and extensible framework for handling different types of data in the Alephium blockchain. Its use of metrics allows for detailed monitoring and analysis of the blockchain's performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of a ChainHandler class that handles validation and addition of flow data to a block flow.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code imports several libraries such as io.prometheus.client, org.alephium.flow.core, org.alephium.flow.model, org.alephium.flow.validation, org.alephium.io, org.alephium.protocol.config, org.alephium.protocol.mining, org.alephium.protocol.model, org.alephium.serde, and org.alephium.util.

3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?
- This code tracks several metrics using Prometheus, such as chain validation failed/error count, total number of chain validations, duration of the validation, block duration, current height of the block, and target hash rate.
