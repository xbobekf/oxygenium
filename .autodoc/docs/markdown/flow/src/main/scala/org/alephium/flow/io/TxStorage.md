This code defines a trait and a class for storing transaction indexes in RocksDB. The trait `TxStorage` extends the `KeyValueStorage` trait and defines two methods for adding transaction indexes to the storage. The `add` method adds a transaction index to the storage and the `addUnsafe` method does the same but without returning an `IOResult`. The `TxRocksDBStorage` class extends the `RocksDBKeyValueStorage` class and implements the `TxStorage` trait. It also defines two methods for removing transaction indexes from the storage, but these methods are not implemented and throw an exception if called.

The `TxRocksDBStorage` object is a companion object for the `TxRocksDBStorage` class and extends the `RocksDBKeyValueCompanion` object. It defines an `apply` method that creates a new instance of the `TxRocksDBStorage` class with the given parameters.

This code is part of the Alephium project and is used to store transaction indexes in RocksDB. The `TxRocksDBStorage` class can be used by other parts of the project that need to store transaction indexes. For example, the `BlockChain` class may use this class to store transaction indexes for blocks in the blockchain. Here is an example of how this class may be used:

```scala
val storage = new RocksDBSource(...)
val cf = ColumnFamily("tx-indexes")
val writeOptions = new WriteOptions()
val readOptions = new ReadOptions()
val txStorage = TxRocksDBStorage(storage, cf, writeOptions, readOptions)

val txId = TransactionId(...)
val txIndex = TxIndex(...)
txStorage.add(txId, txIndex)
```

This code creates a new instance of the `TxRocksDBStorage` class with the given parameters and adds a transaction index to the storage. The `TransactionId` and `TxIndex` classes are part of the Alephium project and represent transaction IDs and indexes, respectively.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a trait and a class for storing transaction indexes in RocksDB for the Alephium blockchain project.

2. What other classes or libraries does this code depend on?
   
   This code depends on the `org.rocksdb` library, as well as several classes from the Alephium project, including `BlockChain`, `TransactionId`, and `AVector`.

3. What methods are available for adding and removing transaction indexes?
   
   The `TxStorage` trait defines two methods for adding transaction indexes: `add` and `addUnsafe`. The `TxRocksDBStorage` class overrides the `remove` and `removeUnsafe` methods from its parent class, but these methods are not implemented and will throw an exception if called.
