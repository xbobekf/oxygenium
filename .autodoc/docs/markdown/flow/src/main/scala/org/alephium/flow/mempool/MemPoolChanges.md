This file contains code related to the mempool functionality of the Alephium project. The mempool is a data structure that stores unconfirmed transactions that have been broadcasted to the network. The purpose of this file is to define two case classes that represent changes to the mempool: Normal and Reorg.

The MemPoolChanges trait is a Scala trait that defines the interface for mempool changes. It is extended by two case classes: Normal and Reorg. The Normal case class represents a normal mempool change, where a set of transactions are removed from the mempool. The Reorg case class represents a mempool change due to a blockchain reorganization, where a set of transactions are removed from the mempool and a set of new transactions are added to the mempool.

The Normal case class takes a single argument, which is a vector of tuples. Each tuple contains a ChainIndex and a vector of Transactions. The ChainIndex represents the index of the chain where the transactions were included, and the vector of Transactions represents the transactions that were removed from the mempool.

The Reorg case class takes two arguments, both of which are vectors of tuples. The first vector represents the transactions that were removed from the mempool, and the second vector represents the transactions that were added to the mempool. Each tuple in both vectors contains a ChainIndex and a vector of Transactions, just like in the Normal case class.

These case classes are used to represent changes to the mempool in the Alephium project. For example, when a new block is added to the blockchain, the mempool may need to be updated to remove transactions that were included in the block. This can be represented using the Normal case class. Similarly, when a blockchain reorganization occurs, the mempool may need to be updated to remove transactions that were included in the old chain and add transactions that were included in the new chain. This can be represented using the Reorg case class.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall Alephium project?
   - This code defines a trait and two case classes related to changes in the mempool of the Alephium blockchain. It is part of the Alephium project's implementation of the mempool functionality.
2. What is the difference between the `Normal` and `Reorg` case classes?
   - The `Normal` case class represents normal removal of transactions from the mempool, while the `Reorg` case class represents removal and addition of transactions due to a blockchain reorganization.
3. What other modules or components of the Alephium project interact with this code?
   - It is not clear from this code alone what other modules or components interact with it. Further investigation of the Alephium project's codebase would be necessary to answer this question.
