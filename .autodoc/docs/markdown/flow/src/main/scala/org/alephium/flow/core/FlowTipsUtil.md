The `FlowTipsUtil` trait in the Alephium project provides utility methods for managing the flow of tips in a blockchain. Tips are the latest blocks in a blockchain, and this trait helps in handling the dependencies between blocks, merging tips, and calculating the differences between tips.

The trait defines several methods for working with tips:

- `getInTip`, `getOutTip`, and `getGroupTip` methods are used to retrieve the in-tip, out-tip, and group-tip of a block, respectively. These methods are useful for navigating the block dependencies in a blockchain.
- `getInOutTips` method calculates the in-tips and out-tips for a given block header and group index. This is useful for determining the dependencies between blocks in a blockchain.
- `getTipsDiff` and `getTipsDiffUnsafe` methods calculate the difference between two sets of tips. This is useful for determining the blocks that have been added or removed between two sets of tips.
- `getFlowTipsUnsafe` and `getLightTipsUnsafe` methods retrieve the flow tips and light tips for a given block hash and target group index, respectively. Flow tips and light tips are used to manage the dependencies between blocks in a blockchain.
- `tryMergeUnsafe` and `merge` methods are used to merge two sets of tips, if possible. This is useful for combining the tips from two different branches of a blockchain.
- `isExtendingUnsafe` method checks if a given block hash extends another block hash. This is useful for determining if a block is a descendant of another block in a blockchain.

These utility methods are essential for managing the flow of tips in a blockchain, which is crucial for maintaining the consistency and integrity of the blockchain data.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `FlowTipsUtil` trait and how is it used in the Alephium project?
   **Answer**: The `FlowTipsUtil` trait provides utility methods for handling flow tips in the Alephium project, such as merging tips, getting tips differences, and managing block dependencies. It is used to manage the flow of blocks and their relationships within the Alephium blockchain.

2. **Question**: What are the main data structures used in this code, such as `BlockHash`, `BlockHeader`, and `BlockDeps`?
   **Answer**: `BlockHash` represents the hash of a block, `BlockHeader` contains metadata about a block (such as its chain index, dependencies, and other information), and `BlockDeps` represents the block dependencies, which include both incoming and outgoing dependencies for a block.

3. **Question**: How does the `tryMergeUnsafe` method work and what is its purpose in the context of flow tips?
   **Answer**: The `tryMergeUnsafe` method attempts to merge two sets of flow tips (represented by `FlowTips` and `FlowTips.Light` objects) by merging their in-tips and out-tips. It returns an `Option[FlowTips]`, which contains the merged flow tips if the merge is successful, or `None` if the merge is not possible due to conflicts or other issues. This method is used to update the flow tips when new blocks are added to the blockchain.
