This file contains code related to message serialization and deserialization for the Alephium network bootstrap process. The purpose of this code is to define a set of message types that can be sent between nodes during the bootstrap process, and to provide methods for serializing and deserializing these messages into a binary format that can be transmitted over the network.

The `Message` trait defines the set of message types that can be sent during the bootstrap process. There are four message types defined: `Peer`, `Clique`, `Ack`, and `Ready`. Each message type is defined as a case class that contains the necessary information for that message type.

The `serializeBody` method is used to serialize a message into a binary format that can be transmitted over the network. This method takes a `Message` object as input and returns a `ByteString` object that contains the serialized binary data. The serialization format is defined by the `ByteString` objects that are concatenated together based on the message type.

The `deserializeBody` method is used to deserialize a binary message received over the network into a `Message` object. This method takes a `ByteString` object as input and returns a `SerdeResult` object that contains either a `Message` object or a `SerdeError` object if the deserialization fails. The deserialization process involves parsing the binary data and constructing the appropriate `Message` object based on the message type.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and extensible framework for defining and transmitting messages during the Alephium network bootstrap process. By defining a set of message types and providing methods for serializing and deserializing these messages, this code enables nodes to communicate with each other during the bootstrap process and establish the initial network topology. 

Example usage:

```
val peerInfo = PeerInfo(...)
val message = Message.Peer(peerInfo)
val serialized = Message.serializeBody(message)
// transmit serialized message over the network
...
val received = ByteString(...)
val deserialized = Message.deserializeBody(received)
deserialized match {
  case Right(message) => // handle received message
  case Left(error) => // handle deserialization error
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Message` trait and its subclasses?
- The `Message` trait and its subclasses define different types of messages that can be sent during the bootstrap process of the Alephium network.

2. What is the `serializeBody` method used for?
- The `serializeBody` method is used to serialize a `Message` object into a `ByteString` representation that can be sent over the network.

3. What is the `deserializeBody` method used for?
- The `deserializeBody` method is used to deserialize a `ByteString` representation of a `Message` object back into its original form, using the appropriate `deserialize` method based on the message type code.
