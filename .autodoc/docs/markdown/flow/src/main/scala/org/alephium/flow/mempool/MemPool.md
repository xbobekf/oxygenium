The code in this file is responsible for managing the memory pool (MemPool) of the Alephium project. The memory pool is a critical component in blockchain systems, as it stores unconfirmed transactions before they are included in a block. The MemPool class in this code is designed to store and manage these unconfirmed transactions efficiently.

Transactions in the memory pool are ordered based on their weights, which are calculated from their fees. This allows the system to prioritize transactions with higher fees when selecting them for inclusion in a block. The MemPool class provides various methods for adding, removing, and querying transactions in the memory pool.

For example, the `add` method is used to add a new transaction to the memory pool. It checks if the transaction already exists in the pool, if the pool is full, or if the transaction is a double-spending attempt. If the transaction passes these checks, it is added to the memory pool and categorized accordingly.

The `removeUsedTxs` and `removeUnusedTxs` methods are used to remove transactions from the memory pool. These methods are typically called when a new block is added to the blockchain, and the transactions in the block need to be removed from the memory pool.

The `reorg` method is used to handle chain reorganizations, which can occur when multiple blocks are added to the blockchain simultaneously. This method removes transactions from the old chain and adds transactions from the new chain to the memory pool.

The `getRelevantUtxos` method is used to retrieve unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) relevant to a specific lockup script. This is useful for constructing new transactions that spend these UTXOs.

Overall, the MemPool class plays a crucial role in managing unconfirmed transactions in the Alephium project, ensuring that the system can efficiently prioritize and process transactions based on their fees and other factors.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `MemPool` class in this code?
   **Answer**: The `MemPool` class is used to store all the unconfirmed transactions in the Alephium project. It provides methods for adding, removing, and querying transactions, as well as handling reorganizations and cleaning up old transactions.

2. **Question**: How does the code handle adding a new transaction to the `MemPool` when it is full?
   **Answer**: When the `MemPool` is full, it checks if the new transaction has a higher weight (based on fees) than the lowest weight transaction in the pool. If so, it removes the lowest weight transaction and adds the new transaction. Otherwise, it returns a `MemPoolIsFull` status.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `NewTxCategory` sealed trait and its subclasses?
   **Answer**: The `NewTxCategory` sealed trait represents the result of adding a new transaction to the `MemPool`. Its subclasses (`AddedToMemPool`, `MemPoolIsFull`, `DoubleSpending`, and `AlreadyExisted`) represent different outcomes of the add operation, such as successfully added, mempool is full, double-spending detected, or the transaction already exists in the mempool.
