The `UdpServer` class is a Scala implementation of a UDP server that can be used to send and receive data over a network. It is part of the Alephium project and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The class defines a number of commands and events that can be used to interact with the server. The `Bind` command is used to bind the server to a specific network address, while the `Send` command is used to send data to a remote address. The `Read` command is used internally to read data from the network.

The `UdpServer` class uses a non-blocking I/O model to handle incoming and outgoing data. When the server is started, it creates a `DatagramChannel` and registers it with a `SelectionHandler`. The `SelectionHandler` is responsible for monitoring the channel for incoming data and notifying the server when data is available to be read.

When data is received, the server reads it into a buffer and sends it to the `discoveryServer` actor, which is responsible for handling the data. The `discoveryServer` actor can then process the data as needed.

The `UdpServer` class also includes error handling code to handle failures that may occur during operation. If an error occurs, the server logs a warning message and attempts to recover. If the error is fatal, the server stops itself.

Overall, the `UdpServer` class provides a simple and efficient way to send and receive data over a network using UDP. It can be used as part of a larger network application to handle incoming and outgoing data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a part of the `alephium` project and it implements a UDP server that can bind to a specific address and send/receive data over UDP.

2. What is the license for this code?
- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.

3. How does this code handle UDP packet reception?
- The `listening` method is responsible for receiving UDP packets. It uses a `ByteBuffer` to read data from the channel and sends the received data to the `discoveryServer` actor. It uses tail recursion to read multiple packets if available, and registers a task with the `sharedSelectionHandler` to resume reading when the channel is ready for more data.
