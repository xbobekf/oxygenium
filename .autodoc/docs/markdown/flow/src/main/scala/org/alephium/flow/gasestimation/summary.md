The code in the `gasestimation` folder is responsible for estimating the amount of gas required to execute various types of scripts in the Alephium blockchain. Gas is a measure of computational effort required to execute a script and is used to prevent spamming and denial-of-service attacks on the network.

The `AssetScriptGasEstimator.scala` file contains code related to estimating the gas required to execute a given asset script. It defines the `AssetScriptGasEstimator` trait, which has two methods: `estimate` and `setInputs`. The `estimate` method takes an `UnlockScript.P2SH` object and returns an `Either` object containing a `GasBox` or an error message. The `setInputs` method sets the transaction inputs for the estimator. This file has three implementations of the `AssetScriptGasEstimator` trait: `Default`, `Mock`, and `NotImplemented`. The `Default` object is the main implementation and estimates the gas required by running the script in a simulated environment.

The `GasEstimation.scala` file provides several methods for estimating gas based on different types of scripts. For example, the `sweepAddress` method estimates gas required for unlocking a P2PKH address, and the `estimateWithP2PKHInputs` method estimates gas required for unlocking multiple P2PKH inputs. Developers can use these methods to estimate the amount of gas required for executing different types of scripts, which can help them optimize their code and avoid running out of gas during execution.

The `TxScriptGasEstimator.scala` file contains code related to gas estimation for transaction scripts. It defines the `TxScriptGasEstimator` trait, which has an `estimate` method that takes a `StatefulScript` object as input and returns an `Either` object containing either an error message or a `GasBox` object. The `GasBox` object contains the amount of gas required to execute the script. This file has two implementations of the `TxScriptGasEstimator` trait: `Default` and `Mock`. The `Default` object estimates the amount of gas required by simulating the execution of the transaction script on a mock blockchain.

Here's an example of how the `GasEstimation` object might be used:

```scala
import org.alephium.flow.gasestimation.GasEstimation

val gasEstimation = GasEstimation()
val p2pkhInputs = List(input1, input2, input3)
val gasRequired = gasEstimation.estimateWithP2PKHInputs(p2pkhInputs)
```

In this example, the `GasEstimation` object is used to estimate the gas required for unlocking multiple P2PKH inputs. This information can be used by developers to optimize their scripts and ensure they don't run out of gas during execution.

Overall, the code in the `gasestimation` folder plays a crucial role in the Alephium project by enabling efficient gas estimation for various types of scripts, which is essential for optimizing the performance of the blockchain.
