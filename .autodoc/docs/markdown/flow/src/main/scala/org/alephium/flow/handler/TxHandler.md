This code is part of the Alephium project and defines the `TxHandler` class, which is responsible for handling transactions in the Alephium blockchain. The `TxHandler` class is responsible for adding transactions to the memory pool, broadcasting transactions to other nodes, downloading transactions from other nodes, and mining transactions in development mode.

The `TxHandler` class has several traits that provide specific functionalities:

1. `TxCoreHandler`: Handles the core transaction processing logic, including adding transactions to the memory pool, handling invalid transactions, and processing transactions during intra-clique syncing.
2. `DownloadTxsHandler`: Handles downloading transactions from other nodes by managing a cache of transaction announcements and periodically requesting the transactions from the corresponding nodes.
3. `BroadcastTxsHandler`: Handles broadcasting transactions to other nodes by managing a cache of outgoing transactions and periodically broadcasting them to other nodes in the network.
4. `AutoMineHandler`: Provides functionality for mining transactions in development mode, which is useful for testing and development purposes.
5. `TxHandlerPersistence`: Handles the persistence of transactions in the memory pool, including loading persisted transactions on startup and persisting transactions when the node is stopped.

The `TxHandler` class is used in the larger Alephium project to manage the processing of transactions and their interactions with other nodes in the network. For example, when a new transaction is received, it is added to the memory pool using the `AddToMemPool` command. If the transaction is valid, it will be broadcasted to other nodes using the `BroadcastTxs` command. If the transaction is invalid, it will be handled accordingly based on the specific error encountered.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `TxHandler` class in the Alephium project?**

   The `TxHandler` class is responsible for handling various transaction-related tasks, such as adding transactions to the memory pool, broadcasting transactions, downloading transactions, and mining transactions for development purposes.

2. **How does the `TxHandler` class handle missing input transactions?**

   The `TxHandler` class maintains a buffer called `missingInputsTxBuffer` to store transactions with missing inputs. It periodically cleans the buffer and validates the root transactions with missing inputs. If a transaction becomes valid, it is added to the memory pool and removed from the buffer.

3. **What is the purpose of the `AutoMineHandler` trait in the Alephium project?**

   The `AutoMineHandler` trait is responsible for automatically mining transactions for development purposes. It provides a method `mineTxsForDev` that mines transactions and publishes the mined blocks to the network. This trait is useful for testing and development scenarios where automatic mining is required.
