This code defines a storage mechanism for BlockState objects in the Alephium project. The BlockStateStorage trait extends the KeyValueStorage trait and specifies that the key is a BlockHash and the value is a BlockState. The storageKey method is overridden to concatenate the bytes of the BlockHash with a ByteString that represents the postfix for the block state. 

The BlockStateRockDBStorage object is a companion object that extends the RocksDBKeyValueCompanion trait and provides an apply method that creates a new instance of the BlockStateRockDBStorage class. This method takes a RocksDBSource object, a ColumnFamily object, and WriteOptions and ReadOptions objects as parameters. The BlockStateRockDBStorage class extends the RocksDBKeyValueStorage class and implements the BlockStateStorage trait. It takes the same parameters as the apply method and passes them to the superclass constructor.

Overall, this code provides a way to store and retrieve BlockState objects using RocksDB as the underlying storage mechanism. It can be used in the larger Alephium project to persist BlockState objects between runs of the system. For example, when a new block is added to the blockchain, its BlockState can be stored using this mechanism so that it can be retrieved later when needed. 

Example usage:

```
val storage = new RocksDBSource(...)
val cf = new ColumnFamily(...)
val writeOptions = new WriteOptions()
val readOptions = new ReadOptions()

val blockStateStorage = BlockStateRockDBStorage(storage, cf, writeOptions, readOptions)

val blockHash = BlockHash(...)
val blockState = BlockState(...)
blockStateStorage.put(blockHash, blockState)

val retrievedBlockState = blockStateStorage.get(blockHash)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a storage mechanism for `BlockState` objects in the Alephium project using RocksDB as the underlying key-value store.

2. What is the license for this code?
   
   This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.

3. What is the relationship between `BlockStateRockDBStorage` and `BlockStateStorage`?
   
   `BlockStateRockDBStorage` is a concrete implementation of `BlockStateStorage` that uses RocksDB as the underlying storage mechanism.
