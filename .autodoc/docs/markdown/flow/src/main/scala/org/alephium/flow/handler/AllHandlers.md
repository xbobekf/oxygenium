This file contains the implementation of the `AllHandlers` class, which is responsible for managing all the handlers used in the Alephium project. The `AllHandlers` class is a container for the following handlers: `FlowHandler`, `TxHandler`, `DependencyHandler`, `ViewHandler`, `BlockChainHandler`, and `HeaderChainHandler`. 

The `AllHandlers` class provides methods to retrieve the handlers and to build them. The `build` method is used to create all the handlers and returns an instance of the `AllHandlers` class. The `buildWithFlowHandler` method is used to build the handlers with a pre-existing `FlowHandler`. 

The `AllHandlers` class has the following methods:
- `orderedHandlers`: returns a sequence of all the handlers in the order they should be started.
- `getBlockHandler`: returns an optional `BlockChainHandler` for a given `ChainIndex`.
- `getBlockHandlerUnsafe`: returns a `BlockChainHandler` for a given `ChainIndex`. This method assumes that the `ChainIndex` is valid.
- `getHeaderHandler`: returns an optional `HeaderChainHandler` for a given `ChainIndex`.
- `getHeaderHandlerUnsafe`: returns a `HeaderChainHandler` for a given `ChainIndex`. This method assumes that the `ChainIndex` is invalid.

The `AllHandlers` class is used in the Alephium project to manage all the handlers used in the project. The `FlowHandler` is responsible for managing the flow of blocks in the network. The `TxHandler` is responsible for managing the transactions in the network. The `DependencyHandler` is responsible for managing the dependencies between blocks. The `ViewHandler` is responsible for managing the views of the network. The `BlockChainHandler` is responsible for managing the blockchain for a given `ChainIndex`. The `HeaderChainHandler` is responsible for managing the header chain for a given `ChainIndex`. 

Overall, the `AllHandlers` class is a crucial component of the Alephium project as it manages all the handlers used in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AllHandlers` class?
- The `AllHandlers` class is a container for various actor handlers used in the Alephium project, including `FlowHandler`, `TxHandler`, `DependencyHandler`, `ViewHandler`, `BlockChainHandler`, and `HeaderChainHandler`.

2. What is the purpose of the `build` methods in the `AllHandlers` object?
- The `build` methods are used to create instances of the `AllHandlers` class with the appropriate actor handlers and dependencies. There are three different `build` methods, each with different parameters and purposes.

3. What is the purpose of the `BrokerConfig` and `ConsensusConfig` objects?
- The `BrokerConfig` and `ConsensusConfig` objects are used to configure the behavior of the Alephium network, including the number of groups and nodes in the network, the consensus algorithm used, and various other settings. These objects are passed as implicit parameters to many of the methods in the `AllHandlers` object.
