The `DependencyHandler` class is part of the Alephium project and is responsible for handling dependencies between blocks and headers. It receives `AddFlowData` commands that contain a vector of `FlowData` objects and a `DataOrigin` value. The `FlowData` objects represent blocks or headers that need to be validated, and the `DataOrigin` value indicates whether the data is coming from the network or from the local node.

When the `DependencyHandler` receives an `AddFlowData` command, it adds the `FlowData` objects to its `pending` cache. If a `FlowData` object is not already in the cache, the handler checks if the block or header dependencies are already in the `blockFlow` cache. If any dependencies are missing, the handler adds them to its `missing` cache and updates its `missingIndex` cache to keep track of which blocks or headers are missing a given dependency. If all dependencies are present, the `FlowData` object is added to the `readies` set.

The `DependencyHandler` periodically checks the `pending` cache for expired entries and removes them. It also checks the `missing` cache for blocks or headers that are now ready to be validated and adds them to the `readies` set.

When the `DependencyHandler` receives a `ChainHandler.FlowDataAdded` event, it removes the corresponding `FlowData` object from the `pending` cache and the `processing` set. It also updates the `missing` and `missingIndex` caches to reflect the fact that the `FlowData` object is now available. If any blocks or headers were waiting for the `FlowData` object to become available, they are added to the `readies` set.

The `DependencyHandler` periodically sends `Validate` commands to the appropriate `BlockChainHandler` or `HeaderChainHandler` actors for each `FlowData` object in the `readies` set. If a `FlowData` object fails validation, the `DependencyHandler` sends an `Invalid` command to itself with the corresponding block or header hash.

The `DependencyHandler` also responds to `GetPendings` commands by sending a `Pendings` event to the sender with a vector of block and header hashes that are still pending validation.

Overall, the `DependencyHandler` is an important component of the Alephium project that helps ensure that blocks and headers are validated in the correct order and that all dependencies are satisfied before validation begins.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines the `DependencyHandler` class and its associated objects, which are used to manage dependencies between blocks and headers in the Alephium project.

2. What are the main data structures used in this code?
- The code uses several mutable data structures, including `LinkedHashMap`, `ArrayBuffer`, and `HashSet`, to keep track of pending, missing, and ready blocks and headers.

3. What is the role of the `BlockFlow` and `NetworkSetting` objects in this code?
- The `BlockFlow` object is used to check whether a block or header is already present in the system, while the `NetworkSetting` object is used to determine the expiration period for dependencies. Both objects are passed as implicit parameters to the `DependencyHandler` constructor.
