This file contains the definition of the `FlowTips` class and the `FlowTips.Light` case class, as well as a companion object for `FlowTips`. 

`FlowTips` is a case class that represents the tips of a flow in the Alephium blockchain. A flow is a set of blocks that are connected to each other and form a chain. The tips of a flow are the blocks that have no children in the flow, i.e., they are the last blocks in the flow. The `FlowTips` class has three fields: `targetGroup`, which is the index of the group to which the flow belongs; `inTips`, which is a vector of block hashes representing the tips that are parents of the next block in the flow; and `outTips`, which is a vector of block hashes representing the tips that are not parents of any block in the flow. 

The `FlowTips` class has two methods: `toBlockDeps` and `sameAs`. The `toBlockDeps` method returns a `BlockDeps` object that represents the dependencies of the tips. The `BlockDeps` object is a case class that contains two vectors of block hashes: `inDeps` and `outDeps`. The `toBlockDeps` method concatenates the `inTips` and `outTips` vectors and returns a `BlockDeps` object that has these concatenated vectors as its `inDeps` and `outDeps` fields. 

The `sameAs` method takes a `BlockDeps` object as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the `inTips` and `outTips` vectors of the `FlowTips` object are equal to the `inDeps` and `outDeps` vectors of the `BlockDeps` object, respectively. 

The `FlowTips.Light` case class is a lightweight version of `FlowTips` that only contains the `inTips` and `outTip` fields. The `outTip` field is a single block hash representing the last block in the flow. 

The companion object for `FlowTips` contains a `from` method that takes a `BlockDeps` object and a `GroupIndex` as arguments and returns a `FlowTips` object. The `from` method creates a `FlowTips` object with the `inDeps` and `outDeps` vectors of the `BlockDeps` object as its `inTips` and `outTips` fields, respectively, and the `GroupIndex` argument as its `targetGroup` field. 

Overall, this code provides a way to represent and manipulate the tips of a flow in the Alephium blockchain. It can be used in the larger project to perform various operations on flows, such as verifying their validity and constructing new flows. 

Example usage:
```
val inTips = AVector(BlockHash("hash1"), BlockHash("hash2"))
val outTips = AVector(BlockHash("hash3"), BlockHash("hash4"))
val targetGroup = GroupIndex(1)
val flowTips = FlowTips(targetGroup, inTips, outTips)
val blockDeps = flowTips.toBlockDeps
val same = flowTips.sameAs(blockDeps) // true
val light = FlowTips.Light(inTips, BlockHash("hash4"))
val newFlowTips = FlowTips.from(blockDeps, targetGroup)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FlowTips` class?
   - The `FlowTips` class represents a set of tips for a specific group of blocks in the Alephium protocol, with both incoming and outgoing tips.
   
2. What is the `toBlockDeps` method used for?
   - The `toBlockDeps` method is used to convert the `FlowTips` object into a `BlockDeps` object, which represents the dependencies of a block in the Alephium protocol.

3. What is the difference between `FlowTips` and `FlowTips.Light`?
   - `FlowTips` represents a set of incoming and outgoing tips for a specific group of blocks, while `FlowTips.Light` only represents a single outgoing tip for a block.
