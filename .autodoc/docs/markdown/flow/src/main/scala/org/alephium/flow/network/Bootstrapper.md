This code defines the `Bootstrapper` class and its related classes and methods. The `Bootstrapper` class is responsible for bootstrapping the network by connecting nodes and creating cliques. The code is part of the Alephium project, which is a decentralized blockchain platform.

The `Bootstrapper` class has three subclasses: `SingleNodeCliqueBootstrapper`, `CliqueCoordinatorBootstrapper`, and `BrokerBootstrapper`. The `props` method is used to create a new instance of the `Bootstrapper` class. The `props` method takes three arguments: `tcpController`, `cliqueManager`, and `nodeStateStorage`. The `tcpController` and `cliqueManager` arguments are `ActorRefT` objects, which are used to send messages to other actors. The `nodeStateStorage` argument is used to store and retrieve data from the node's local storage.

The `Bootstrapper` class has three commands: `ForwardConnection`, `GetIntraCliqueInfo`, and `SendIntraCliqueInfo`. The `ForwardConnection` command is used to forward a connection to the clique manager. The `GetIntraCliqueInfo` command is used to retrieve information about the clique. The `SendIntraCliqueInfo` command is used to send information about the clique.

The `CliqueCoordinatorBootstrapper` class is used when the node is a clique coordinator. The `cliqueCoordinator` object is created using the `CliqueCoordinator.props` method. The `CliqueCoordinator` class is responsible for managing the clique.

The `BrokerBootstrapper` class is used when the node is a broker. The `broker` object is created using the `Broker.props` method. The `Broker` class is responsible for managing the brokers.

The `SingleNodeCliqueBootstrapper` class is used when the node is a single node clique bootstrapper. The `createIntraCliqueInfo` method is used to create information about the clique. The `SendIntraCliqueInfo` command is used to send the information to the clique manager.

The `BootstrapperHandler` trait is used to define common methods and variables for the `Bootstrapper` subclasses. The `preStart` method is used to start the TCP controller. The `loadOrGenDiscoveryKey` method is used to load or generate the discovery key. The `persistBootstrapInfo` method is used to persist the bootstrap information. The `awaitInfoWithForward` method is used to wait for information and forward connections. The `awaitInfo` method is used to wait for information. The `ready` method is used to retrieve information about the clique. The `forwardConnection` method is used to forward connections to the clique manager.

Overall, this code is responsible for bootstrapping the network by connecting nodes and creating cliques. The `Bootstrapper` class has three subclasses that are used depending on the node's role. The `BootstrapperHandler` trait defines common methods and variables for the `Bootstrapper` subclasses.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Bootstrapper` class and its related classes?
- The `Bootstrapper` class and its related classes are responsible for bootstrapping the network and coordinating the connection between nodes in the Alephium network.

2. What is the role of the `CliqueCoordinatorBootstrapper` class?
- The `CliqueCoordinatorBootstrapper` class is responsible for starting the `CliqueCoordinator` actor and forwarding incoming connections to it. It is used when the node is configured as a coordinator.

3. What is the purpose of the `loadOrGenDiscoveryKey` method?
- The `loadOrGenDiscoveryKey` method is used to load or generate a new discovery key pair for the node. This key pair is used to identify the node and establish connections with other nodes in the network.
