The `DiscoveryServer` is a class that implements a variant of the Kademlia protocol. The purpose of this protocol is to discover and maintain a list of peers in a peer-to-peer network. The `DiscoveryServer` is part of the `alephium` project and is responsible for discovering and maintaining a list of brokers in the network.

The `DiscoveryServer` class extends `IOBaseActor` and `Stash` and has several case classes and traits. The `DiscoveryServer` class has a `receive` method that is initially set to `awaitCliqueInfo`. This method waits for a `SendCliqueInfo` message that contains the `CliqueInfo` for the server. Once the `CliqueInfo` is received, the `DiscoveryServer` class sets the `selfCliqueInfo` variable to the received `CliqueInfo`, caches the brokers in the `CliqueInfo`, and starts binding to the UDP socket.

The `DiscoveryServer` class has several methods that handle different types of messages. The `handleUdp` method handles messages received from the UDP socket. The `handleCommand` method handles messages that are commands to the `DiscoveryServer`. The `handleBanning` method handles messages related to banning peers.

The `DiscoveryServer` class has a `handlePayload` method that handles different types of payloads received from peers. The `Ping` payload is used to detect the liveness of a peer. The `Pong` payload is sent back when a valid `Ping` is received. The `FindNode` payload is used to discover peers. The `Neighbors` payload is sent back when a `FindNode` is received.

The `DiscoveryServer` class has a `scheduleScan` method that schedules a scan of the network to discover new peers. The `postInitialDiscovery` method is called when the initial discovery of peers is complete. The `publishNewPeer` method is called when a new peer is discovered.

In summary, the `DiscoveryServer` class is responsible for discovering and maintaining a list of brokers in the `alephium` peer-to-peer network. It implements a variant of the Kademlia protocol and uses UDP to communicate with peers. The `DiscoveryServer` class has methods to handle different types of messages and payloads and schedules scans to discover new peers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a part of the Alephium project and implements a variant of the Kademlia protocol for peer discovery in a P2P network.

2. What are the main components of this code?
- The main components of this code include the `DiscoveryServer` class, which implements the Kademlia protocol, and several case classes and traits that define the messages and events used by the protocol.

3. What is the role of the `BrokerStorage` class in this code?
- The `BrokerStorage` class is used to persist information about active brokers in the P2P network, and is used to cache brokers when the `DiscoveryServer` starts up.
