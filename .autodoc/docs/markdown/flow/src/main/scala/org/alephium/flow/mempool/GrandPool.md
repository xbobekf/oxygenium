The `GrandPool` class is a container for multiple `MemPool` instances, which are used to store unconfirmed transactions. The purpose of this class is to provide a unified interface for interacting with multiple `MemPool` instances, as well as to handle cross-group transactions.

The `GrandPool` class takes in a vector of `MemPool` instances and a `BrokerConfig` instance, which is used to determine the group index of each `MemPool`. The `size` method returns the total number of unconfirmed transactions across all `MemPool` instances. The `getMemPool` method returns the `MemPool` instance corresponding to a given group index.

The `add` method is used to add a single transaction to the appropriate `MemPool` instance. If the transaction is an intra-group transaction, it is added to the `MemPool` instance corresponding to the `from` group index. If the transaction is a cross-group transaction, it is added to the `MemPool` instance corresponding to the `from` group index, and then forwarded to the `MemPool` instance corresponding to the `to` group index. If the `to` group index is not contained in the `BrokerConfig`, the transaction is not forwarded.

The `get` method is used to retrieve a transaction from any of the `MemPool` instances. It takes in a `TransactionId` and returns an `Option[TransactionTemplate]`. If the transaction is not found in any of the `MemPool` instances, `None` is returned.

The `getOutTxsWithTimestamp` method returns a vector of all outgoing transactions with their corresponding timestamps across all `MemPool` instances.

The `clean` method is used to remove all transactions from the `MemPool` instances that are included in a given `BlockFlow`. It takes in a `BlockFlow` instance and a `TimeStamp` threshold, and returns the total number of transactions removed.

The `clear` method is used to remove all transactions from all `MemPool` instances.

The `validateAllTxs` method is used to remove all transactions from the `MemPool` instances that are invalid according to a given `BlockFlow`. It takes in a `BlockFlow` instance and returns the total number of transactions removed.

The `empty` method is a companion object method that returns an empty `GrandPool` instance. It takes in a `BrokerConfig` instance and a `MemPoolSetting` instance, and returns a `GrandPool` instance with empty `MemPool` instances for each group index.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GrandPool` class?
- The `GrandPool` class is a container for multiple `MemPool` instances and provides methods for adding, retrieving, and cleaning transactions from these pools.

2. What is the significance of the `BrokerConfig` parameter in the `GrandPool` constructor and methods?
- The `BrokerConfig` parameter is used to determine the group index of a transaction's source and destination groups, which is necessary for adding transactions to the appropriate `MemPool` instances.

3. What is the difference between `add` and `addXGroupTx` methods in the `GrandPool` class?
- The `add` method adds a transaction to the `MemPool` of the transaction's source group, and if the transaction is an inter-group transaction, it also attempts to add the transaction to the `MemPool` of the transaction's destination group. The `addXGroupTx` method is specifically for adding inter-group transactions to the `MemPool` of the destination group and is only called by the `add` method.
