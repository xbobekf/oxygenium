The `CpuMiner` class is a component of the Oxygenium project that is responsible for mining new blocks on the blockchain. It is designed to work with a specific configuration of brokers and groups, and uses templates to generate new blocks. 

The `CpuMiner` class is an implementation of the `Miner` trait, which defines the basic functionality of a miner. The `CpuMiner` class extends this trait and adds additional functionality specific to CPU mining. 

The `CpuMiner` class has a constructor that takes an `AllHandlers` object, which contains references to all of the handlers used by the miner. The `CpuMiner` class also has a `receive` method that defines the behavior of the miner when it receives messages. 

The `CpuMiner` class has several methods that are used to perform mining tasks. The `subscribeForTasks` method is used to subscribe to new mining tasks, while the `unsubscribeTasks` method is used to unsubscribe from mining tasks. The `publishNewBlock` method is used to publish a new block to the blockchain. 

The `CpuMiner` class also has a `handleMiningTasks` method that defines the behavior of the miner when it receives mining tasks. This method handles new templates, block additions, and invalid blocks. 

The `updateAndStartTasks` method is used to update the miner's pending tasks and start new tasks. This method takes an `IndexedSeq` of `IndexedSeq` of `BlockFlowTemplate` objects, which are used to generate new blocks. 

Overall, the `CpuMiner` class is an important component of the Oxygenium project that is responsible for generating new blocks on the blockchain. It is designed to work with a specific configuration of brokers and groups, and uses templates to generate new blocks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a part of the Oxygenium project and is responsible for CPU mining tasks.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other packages and modules, including Akka, Oxygenium flow client and handlers, Oxygenium protocol config, and Oxygenium flow model.

3. What is the role of the CpuMiner class?
- The CpuMiner class is responsible for handling mining tasks, subscribing to new mining tasks, validating mined blocks, and publishing new blocks. It extends the Miner class and uses the AllHandlers class to interact with other components of the Oxygenium project.
