The `TxIndexes` class is a data structure that indexes transactions in the mempool of the Alephium blockchain. It is used to efficiently query transactions by their inputs, outputs, and addresses. 

The class contains several mutable hash maps that store the following information:
- `inputIndex`: maps an `AssetOutputRef` (a reference to an output of a previous transaction) to the transaction that spends it (`TransactionTemplate`).
- `outputIndex`: maps an `AssetOutputRef` to a tuple containing the output itself (`AssetOutput`) and the transaction that created it (`TransactionTemplate`).
- `addressIndex`: maps a `LockupScript` (a script that locks an output to a specific address) to a list of `AssetOutputRef`s that are locked by that script.
- `outputType`: specifies the type of output (e.g. mempool output, block output).

The `TxIndexes` class provides several methods to add and remove transactions from the mempool, as well as to query the indexed transactions:
- `add`: adds a transaction to the mempool and updates the indexes. Returns the parent and child transactions of the added transaction.
- `addXGroupTx`: adds a cross-group transaction to the mempool and updates the indexes. Returns the child transactions of the added transaction.
- `remove`: removes a transaction from the mempool and updates the indexes.
- `isSpent`: checks if an output is spent by another transaction in the mempool.
- `isDoubleSpending`: checks if a transaction is double-spending (i.e. spending an output that has already been spent by another transaction in the mempool).
- `getRelevantUtxos`: returns a list of unspent outputs that are locked by a specific address.
- `clear`: clears all the indexes.

The `TxIndexes` class is used extensively throughout the Alephium codebase to manage the mempool. For example, it is used in the `Mempool` class to add and remove transactions from the mempool, and in the `TxValidator` class to validate transactions before they are added to the mempool. 

Example usage:
```scala
val txIndexes = TxIndexes.emptyMemPool(mainGroup)
val tx = TransactionTemplate(...)
val (parents, children) = txIndexes.add(tx, tx => tx)
val relevantUtxos = txIndexes.getRelevantUtxos(lockupScript)
txIndexes.remove(tx)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall alephium project?
- This code defines a class called `TxIndexes` which is used to index transactions in the mempool of the alephium project.
- It is part of the `org.alephium.flow.mempool` package and is used to manage transactions in the mempool.

2. What are the main data structures used in this code and how are they used?
- The main data structures used in this code are `mutable.HashMap` and `mutable.ArrayBuffer`.
- They are used to index transactions by their input and output references, lockup scripts, and output types.

3. What are the main functions provided by this code and how are they used?
- The main functions provided by this code are `add`, `addXGroupTx`, `remove`, `isSpent`, `isDoubleSpending`, `getRelevantUtxos`, and `clear`.
- They are used to add and remove transactions from the mempool, check if a transaction output is spent, get relevant unspent transaction outputs, and clear the mempool.
