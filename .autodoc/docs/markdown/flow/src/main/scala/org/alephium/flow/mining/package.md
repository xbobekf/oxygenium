This file contains a package object for the `org.alephium.flow.mining` package in the Alephium project. The purpose of this package object is to define a constant value `MiningDispatcher` which is a string representing the name of an Akka actor dispatcher. 

Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. In the context of the Alephium project, Akka is used to implement the mining process for generating new blocks in the blockchain. The `MiningDispatcher` constant is used to specify which dispatcher should be used for mining-related actors in the system. 

By defining this constant in a package object, it can be easily accessed and used throughout the `org.alephium.flow.mining` package without having to redefine it in each individual file. 

Here is an example of how this constant might be used in a mining-related actor definition:

```
import akka.actor.{Actor, Props}
import org.alephium.flow.mining.MiningDispatcher

class Miner extends Actor {
  override def receive: Receive = {
    case MineBlock => // mine a new block
  }
}

object Miner {
  def props(): Props = Props(new Miner()).withDispatcher(MiningDispatcher)
}
```

In this example, the `Miner` actor is defined with a `props` method that specifies the `MiningDispatcher` constant as the dispatcher to use for this actor. This ensures that the mining-related actors are all using the same dispatcher, which can help with performance and resource allocation.
