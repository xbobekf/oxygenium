This file contains code related to the network broker in the Alephium project. The purpose of this code is to define two types of connections: inbound and outbound. These connection types are represented by the sealed trait `ConnectionType`, which is defined at the beginning of the file. 

The `sealed` keyword means that all possible subtypes of `ConnectionType` must be defined in this file. In this case, there are two subtypes: `InboundConnection` and `OutboundConnection`, which are defined as objects. 

These connection types are likely used throughout the project to differentiate between incoming and outgoing network connections. For example, the network broker may use this information to prioritize incoming connections over outgoing connections, or to apply different rules to each type of connection. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```scala
import org.alephium.flow.network.broker._

// Define a function that takes a ConnectionType parameter
def handleConnection(connType: ConnectionType): Unit = {
  connType match {
    case InboundConnection => println("Handling incoming connection")
    case OutboundConnection => println("Handling outgoing connection")
  }
}

// Call the function with an inbound connection
handleConnection(InboundConnection) // prints "Handling incoming connection"

// Call the function with an outbound connection
handleConnection(OutboundConnection) // prints "Handling outgoing connection"
```

In this example, the `handleConnection` function takes a `ConnectionType` parameter and prints a message based on the type of connection. The `InboundConnection` and `OutboundConnection` objects from the `org.alephium.flow.network.broker` package are used to create instances of the `ConnectionType` trait.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ConnectionType` sealed trait and its two case objects?
   - The `ConnectionType` sealed trait and its two case objects (`InboundConnection` and `OutboundConnection`) are likely used to differentiate between incoming and outgoing network connections in the `org.alephium.flow.network.broker` module.

2. What is the significance of the GNU Lesser General Public License mentioned in the comments?
   - The GNU Lesser General Public License is a type of open source software license that allows for the library to be freely distributed and modified, but with certain restrictions and requirements. Developers may want to know more about the specific terms and conditions of this license.

3. What is the purpose of the `org.alephium.flow.network.broker` package?
   - It is unclear from this code alone what the `org.alephium.flow.network.broker` package is used for. A smart developer may want to investigate other files within this package or consult documentation to understand its purpose within the larger `alephium` project.
