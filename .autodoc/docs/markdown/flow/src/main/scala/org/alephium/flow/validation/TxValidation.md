The code in this file is part of the Alephium project and focuses on transaction validation. It defines a `TxValidation` trait and its implementation, which are responsible for validating various aspects of a transaction, such as its structure, inputs, outputs, gas usage, and script execution.

The `TxValidation` trait provides several methods for validating different parts of a transaction, such as `checkStateless`, `checkStateful`, and `checkTxScript`. These methods are used in the larger project to ensure that transactions are valid before they are added to the blockchain or mempool.

For example, the `validateMempoolTxTemplate` method is used to validate a transaction template
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TxValidation` trait and how is it used in the Alephium project?
   **Answer**: The `TxValidation` trait defines a set of methods for validating various aspects of a transaction, such as checking the version, network ID, input and output numbers, gas bounds, and more. It is used in the Alephium project to ensure that transactions are valid before they are added to the blockchain or mempool.

2. **Question**: How does the code handle different hard fork scenarios when validating transactions?
   **Answer**: The code takes into account the `hardFork` parameter in various validation methods, such as `checkGasBound`, `checkOutputAmount`, and `checkP2MPKStat`. Depending on the hard fork status, the validation logic may differ to accommodate changes introduced by the hard fork.

3. **Question**: What is the role of the `checkTxScript` method in transaction validation?
