[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/flow/src/main/scala/org/alephium/flow/network/interclique/InboundBrokerHandler.scala)

This code defines a class called `InboundBrokerHandler` and an object called `InboundBrokerHandler` in the `org.alephium.flow.network.interclique` package. The purpose of this code is to handle incoming broker connections in the Alephium network. 

The `InboundBrokerHandler` class extends another class called `BaseInboundBrokerHandler` and implements a trait called `BrokerHandler`. It takes in several parameters, including the `selfCliqueInfo`, `remoteAddress`, `connection`, `blockflow`, `allHandlers`, `cliqueManager`, and `blockFlowSynchronizer`. These parameters are used to handle incoming broker connections and synchronize block flows between different nodes in the network. 

The `InboundBrokerHandler` object defines a `props` method that takes in the same parameters as the `InboundBrokerHandler` class constructor. This method returns a new instance of the `InboundBrokerHandler` class with the given parameters. 

This code is used in the larger Alephium project to handle incoming broker connections and synchronize block flows between different nodes in the network. It is part of the interclique network module, which is responsible for managing communication between different cliques (subnetworks) in the Alephium network. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger Alephium project:

```
val inboundBrokerHandler = InboundBrokerHandler.props(
  selfCliqueInfo,
  remoteAddress,
  connection,
  blockflow,
  allHandlers,
  cliqueManager,
  blockFlowSynchronizer
)
val inboundBrokerHandlerRef = context.actorOf(inboundBrokerHandler)
```

In this example, a new instance of the `InboundBrokerHandler` class is created using the `props` method and the resulting actor reference is stored in `inboundBrokerHandlerRef`. This actor reference can then be used to handle incoming broker connections and synchronize block flows between different nodes in the network.
