This file contains code related to serialization and deserialization of data structures used in the Alephium network bootstrap process. The code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License and is part of the Alephium project.

The `SerdeUtils` trait defines a set of implicit `Serde` instances for two data structures: `PeerInfo` and `IntraCliqueInfo`. `Serde` is a type class that provides serialization and deserialization functionality for a given data type. By defining these implicit instances, the code enables the serialization and deserialization of these data structures in other parts of the project.

The `SerdeUtils` object defines a utility function called `unwrap` that takes a `SerdeResult` of a `Staging[T]` and returns a `SerdeResult` of an `Option[Staging[T]]`. The purpose of this function is to handle the case where there are not enough bytes to deserialize a `Staging[T]`. In this case, the function returns `None`. If there are enough bytes, the function returns `Some(pair)` where `pair` is the deserialized `Staging[T]`. If there is an error during deserialization, the function returns the error.

Overall, this code provides a set of utilities for serializing and deserializing data structures used in the Alephium network bootstrap process. These utilities can be used in other parts of the project to enable communication between nodes in the network. For example, the `PeerInfo` data structure contains information about a peer in the network, such as its IP address and port number. By serializing and deserializing this data structure, nodes can exchange information about other nodes in the network and establish connections.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SerdeUtils` trait and object?
- The `SerdeUtils` trait and object provide implicit serde instances for `PeerInfo` and `IntraCliqueInfo` classes, and a utility method `unwrap` to deserialize optional values.

2. What is the license under which this code is distributed?
- This code is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, either version 3 of the License, or any later version.

3. What is the `unwrap` method used for?
- The `unwrap` method is used to deserialize an optional value of type `Staging[T]` from a `SerdeResult[Staging[T]]`. If there are not enough bytes to deserialize the value, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns `Some(pair)` where `pair` is the deserialized value.
