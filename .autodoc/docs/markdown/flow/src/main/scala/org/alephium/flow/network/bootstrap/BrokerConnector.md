The `BrokerConnector` class is part of the `alephium` project and is responsible for connecting to a broker and sending/receiving messages. The broker is used during the bootstrap phase of the network, where nodes exchange information about the network topology and their roles. 

The `BrokerConnector` class is an Akka actor that communicates with the broker using TCP. It receives a `remoteAddress` and a `connection` as constructor arguments, which are used to create a `connectionHandler` actor. The `connectionHandler` actor is responsible for handling the TCP connection and deserializing incoming messages. 

The `BrokerConnector` actor has three states: `receive`, `forwardCliqueInfo`, and `awaitAck`. In the `receive` state, the actor expects to receive a `Message.Peer` object, which contains information about a peer node in the network. The actor forwards this information to a `cliqueCoordinator` actor and transitions to the `forwardCliqueInfo` state. 

In the `forwardCliqueInfo` state, the actor expects to receive a `Send` command containing an `IntraCliqueInfo` object. The actor serializes the `IntraCliqueInfo` object into a `Message.Clique` object and sends it to the broker using the `connectionHandler` actor. The actor transitions to the `awaitAck` state. 

In the `awaitAck` state, the actor expects to receive a `Message` object from the broker. If the message is an acknowledgement of the `Message.Clique` object, the actor forwards the acknowledgement to the `cliqueCoordinator` actor and transitions to the `forwardReady` state. 

In the `forwardReady` state, the actor expects to receive a `CliqueCoordinator.Ready` message from the `cliqueCoordinator` actor. When this message is received, the actor serializes a `Message.Ready` object and sends it to the broker using the `connectionHandler` actor. If the actor receives a `Terminated` message, it logs a message and stops itself. 

If the actor receives an unexpected message, it logs an error message and shuts down the system. 

The `BrokerConnector` class is used during the bootstrap phase of the network to connect to a broker and exchange information about the network topology and node roles. It is an important part of the `alephium` project's networking infrastructure. 

Example usage: 

```scala
val remoteAddress = new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 8080)
val connection = ???
val cliqueCoordinator = ???
implicit val groupConfig = ???
implicit val networkSetting = ???

val brokerConnector = system.actorOf(BrokerConnector.props(remoteAddress, connection, cliqueCoordinator))
val intraCliqueInfo = ???
brokerConnector ! BrokerConnector.Send(intraCliqueInfo)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is part of the `alephium` project and is responsible for connecting to a broker and forwarding clique information.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code depends on the Akka library, the Alephium project, and the GNU Lesser General Public License.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
    
    This code expects to receive messages containing peer information and clique information, and it sends messages containing clique information and a ready signal. The input and output are expected to be in the form of serialized messages.
