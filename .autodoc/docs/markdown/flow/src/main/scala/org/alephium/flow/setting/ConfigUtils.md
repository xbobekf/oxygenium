The `ConfigUtils` object provides utility functions for parsing and reading configuration values used in the Alephium project. The object contains several implicit value readers that allow for the conversion of configuration values to their corresponding types. 

The `parseMiners` function takes an optional sequence of miner addresses as input and returns an `Either` object containing either a `ConfigException` or an optional `AVector` of `Address.Asset` objects. The function first checks if the input sequence is defined and then calls the `parseAddresses` function to parse the addresses. If the parsing is successful, the function returns an `Option` containing the parsed addresses. Otherwise, it returns a `ConfigException` with an error message.

The `parseAddresses` function takes a vector of raw addresses as input and returns an `Either` object containing either a `ConfigException` or a vector of `Address.Asset` objects. The function first maps over the input vector and calls the `parseAddress` function to parse each address. If all addresses are successfully parsed, the function then calls the `validateAddresses` function from the `Miner` object to validate the addresses. If the validation is successful, the function returns the parsed addresses. Otherwise, it returns a `ConfigException` with an error message.

The `parseAddress` function takes a raw address as input and returns an `Either` object containing either a `ConfigException` or an `Address.Asset` object. The function first attempts to decode the base58-encoded address using the `fromBase58` function from the `Address` object. If the decoding is successful and the resulting address is an `Address.Asset`, the function returns the address. Otherwise, it returns a `ConfigException` with an error message.

The `sha256Config` implicit value reader allows for the conversion of a string to a `Sha256` object. The function first converts the input string to a `Hex` object using the `Hex.from` function. If the conversion is successful, the function then attempts to create a `Sha256` object using the `Sha256.from` function. If the creation is successful, the function returns the `Sha256` object. Otherwise, it throws a `ConfigException` with an error message.

The `networkIdReader` implicit value reader allows for the conversion of an integer to a `NetworkId` object. The function first attempts to create a `NetworkId` object using the `NetworkId.from` function. If the creation is successful, the function returns the `NetworkId` object. Otherwise, it throws a `ConfigException` with an error message.

The `allocationAmountReader` implicit value reader allows for the conversion of a string to an `Allocation.Amount` object. The function first attempts to create a `BigInteger` object using the `java.math.BigInteger` constructor. If the creation is successful, the function then attempts to create an `Allocation.Amount` object using the `Allocation.Amount.from` function. If the creation is not successful, the function throws a `ConfigException` with an error message.

The `timeStampReader` implicit value reader allows for the conversion of a long integer to a `TimeStamp` object. The function first attempts to create a `TimeStamp` object using the `TimeStamp.from` function. If the creation is successful, the function returns the `TimeStamp` object. Otherwise, it throws a `ConfigException` with an error message. 

Overall, the `ConfigUtils` object provides a set of utility functions for parsing and reading configuration values used in the Alephium project. These functions are used throughout the project to ensure that configuration values are properly formatted and validated.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains utility functions and implicit value readers for parsing configuration values related to mining and network settings in the Alephium project.

2. What is the significance of the `ConfigException` type used in this code?
- The `ConfigException` type is used to represent errors that can occur during the parsing of configuration values. It is thrown when there is an issue with the format or content of a configuration value.

3. What is the purpose of the `parseMiners` function?
- The `parseMiners` function takes an optional sequence of miner addresses as input and returns an `Either` value that contains either an error message or an optional vector of validated miner addresses. It uses the `parseAddresses` function to parse and validate the addresses, and returns `None` if the input is empty.
