This code is part of the Alephium project and provides utility functions for handling transactions. The `TxUtils` trait is mixed with the `FlowUtils` trait to provide a set of methods for creating, validating, and managing transactions in the Alephium blockchain.

The main functionalities provided by this code include:

1. **UTXO Selection**: Methods like `getUsableUtxos` and `getUsableUtxosOnce` are used to fetch unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) for a given lockup script and target block hash. These methods ensure that the UTXOs are not affected by concurrent operations.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The `getBalance` method calculates the total balance, locked balance, and the number of all UTXOs for a given lockup script.

3. **Transaction Creation**: Methods like `transfer` and `sweepAddress` are used to create unsigned transactions for transferring assets between addresses. These methods handle various aspects of transaction creation, such as input selection, output generation, gas estimation, and validation.

4. **Transaction Status**: Methods like `isTxConfirmed`, `getTxConfirmedStatus`, and `searchLocalTransactionStatus` are used to check the status of a transaction in the blockchain, such as whether it is confirmed or still in the mempool.

5. **Transaction Retrieval**: Methods like `getTransaction` and `searchTransaction` are used to fetch transactions from the blockchain based on their transaction ID and chain index.

6. **Validation and Error Handling**: The code includes various validation and error handling methods, such as `checkProvidedGas`, `checkOutputInfos`, and `checkUTXOsInSameGroup`, to ensure that transactions are valid and well-formed.

Example usage of this code in the larger project might involve creating a transaction to transfer assets between two addresses:

```scala
val fromPublicKey: PublicKey = ...
val toLockupScript: LockupScript.Asset = ...
val amount: U256 = ...
val gasPrice: GasPrice = ...
val utxoLimit: Int = ...

val result: IOResult[Either[String, UnsignedTransaction]] = transfer(
  fromPublicKey,
  toLockupScript,
  None, // lockTimeOpt
  amount,
  None, // gasOpt
  gasPrice,
  utxoLimit
)
```

This would create an unsigned transaction for transferring the specified amount of assets from the address corresponding to `fromPublicKey` to the address with the `toLockupScript`.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TxUtils` trait and how does it relate to the `FlowUtils` trait?
   **Answer**: The `TxUtils` trait provides utility functions related to transactions, such as transferring assets, checking transaction status, and getting balance information. It extends the `FlowUtils` trait, which provides utility functions related to the blockchain flow, to access and manipulate the underlying blockchain data.

2. **Question**: How does the `transfer` function work and what are its input parameters?
   **Answer**: The `transfer` function is used to create an unsigned transaction for transferring assets between addresses. It takes the following input parameters: `fromPublicKey`, `outputInfos`, `gasOpt`, `gasPrice`, and `utxoLimit`. The function first checks the validity of the provided inputs, then selects the UTXOs to be used in the transaction, and finally builds the unsigned transaction.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `getBalance` function and what does it return?
   **Answer**: The `getBalance` function is used to get the balance information of a given lockup script (address). It takes the `lockupScript` and `utxosLimit` as input parameters. The function returns a tuple containing the total balance, the locked balance, the token balances, the locked token balances, and the number of all UTXOs.
