This code defines a module for managing UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) port mappings. UPnP is a protocol that allows devices to discover and communicate with each other on a network. This module provides functionality for discovering UPnP gateway devices on a network and adding or deleting port mappings on those devices.

The `Upnp` object defines constants and methods for discovering UPnP gateway devices and creating an `UpnpClient` instance to manage port mappings. The `getUpnpClient` method takes an `UpnpSettings` object as input and returns an `Option[UpnpClient]`. This method first sets the HTTP read timeout and discovery timeout based on the settings provided. It then creates a `GatewayDiscover` instance and uses it to discover UPnP gateway devices on the network. If a valid gateway device is found, a new `UpnpClient` instance is created and returned. If no valid gateway device is found, `None` is returned.

The `UpnpClient` class represents a UPnP gateway device and provides methods for adding and deleting port mappings. The `addPortMapping` method takes an external port number and an internal port number as input and returns a `Boolean` indicating whether the port mapping was successfully added. This method uses the `GatewayDevice` instance associated with the `UpnpClient` to add port mappings for both TCP and UDP protocols. The `deletePortMapping` method takes an external port number as input and returns a `Boolean` indicating whether the port mapping was successfully deleted. This method uses the `GatewayDevice` instance associated with the `UpnpClient` to delete port mappings for both TCP and UDP protocols.

Overall, this module provides a way for the Alephium project to manage UPnP port mappings on a network. This could be useful for allowing external clients to connect to the Alephium network without requiring manual port forwarding on the router. For example, a user could run an Alephium node on their home network and use UPnP to automatically configure their router to allow incoming connections to the node.
## Questions:
