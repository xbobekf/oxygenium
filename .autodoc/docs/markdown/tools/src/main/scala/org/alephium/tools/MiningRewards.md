The `MiningRewards` object is a tool that calculates the inflation rate of the Alephium cryptocurrency based on different parameters. The inflation rate is the rate at which the total supply of a cryptocurrency increases over time. The tool calculates the inflation rate based on the hashrate of the network and the number of years since the network's inception.

The tool imports several classes from the Alephium project, including `ALPH`, `GroupConfig`, `Emission`, `Duration`, `Number`, and `U256`. These classes are used to define the parameters needed to calculate the inflation rate.

The `MiningRewards` object defines a `groupConfig` object, which specifies the number of groups in the network. It also defines a `blockTargetTime` object, which specifies the target time for each block to be mined. These parameters are used to calculate the `emission` object, which represents the total amount of new coins that will be created over time.

The `calInflation` method is a private method that takes a `yearlyReward` parameter and calculates the inflation rate based on that reward. The method converts the `yearlyReward` to a `BigDecimal` and divides it by one billion to get the inflation rate as a percentage.

The `printLine` method is a helper method that prints a string to the console with a newline character at the end.

The `emission.rewardsWrtTarget()` method calculates the inflation rate based on the hashrate of the network. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the hashrate and the yearly reward. The tool then iterates over this list and calculates the inflation rate for each tuple using the `calInflation` method. It then prints the hashrate, inflation rate, and yearly reward to the console.

The `emission.rewardsWrtTime()` method calculates the inflation rate based on the number of years since the network's inception. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the year and the yearly reward. The tool then iterates over this list and calculates the inflation rate for each tuple using the `calInflation` method. It then prints the year, inflation rate, and yearly reward to the console.

Overall, the `MiningRewards` object is a useful tool for developers working on the Alephium project who need to calculate the inflation rate of the cryptocurrency based on different parameters. The tool can be used to optimize the network's parameters to achieve a desired inflation rate.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code calculates the inflation rate of the Alephium cryptocurrency based on hash rate and time.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
   - This code imports classes from the `org.alephium` and `org.alephium.util` packages, but it is unclear what external libraries or dependencies are required.

3. What is the output of this code?
   - This code prints two tables to the console: one showing the inflation rate based on hash rate, and another showing the inflation rate based on time. Each table includes three columns: the hash rate or year, the inflation rate as a decimal, and the yearly reward in ALPH.
