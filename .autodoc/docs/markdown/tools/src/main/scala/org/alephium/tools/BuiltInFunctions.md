The `BuiltInFunctions` object is a tool used to generate a JSON file containing information about the built-in functions in the Alephium protocol. The JSON file is generated by extracting information from the `BuiltIn` object, which contains all the built-in functions in the protocol. The extracted information is then formatted into a `FunctionInfo` case class, which contains the name, category, signature, documentation, parameters, and return type of each function. 

The `FunctionInfo` case class is defined with an implicit `ReadWriter` using the `upickle` library, which allows for easy serialization and deserialization of the case class to and from JSON. The `ordering` implicit value is also defined for the `FunctionInfo` case class, which is used to sort the functions by category when writing to the JSON file. 

The `allFunctions` value is defined as an immutable iterable of `FunctionInfo` objects, which is generated by mapping over the `statefulFuncsSeq` sequence in the `BuiltIn` object. The `statefulFuncsSeq` sequence contains all the built-in functions in the protocol, along with their metadata. The `map` function extracts the relevant metadata from each function and formats it into a `FunctionInfo` object. 

The `json` value is defined as a string representation of the `allFunctions` iterable, which is serialized to JSON using the `upickle` library. The JSON string is then written to a file located at `../protocol/src/main/resources/ralph-built-in-functions.json` using a `PrintWriter`. 

This tool is useful for generating documentation for the built-in functions in the Alephium protocol. The generated JSON file can be used by other tools to provide information about the functions to users, such as an IDE or a web-based documentation tool. 

Example usage:
```scala
import org.alephium.tools.BuiltInFunctions

// Generate JSON file containing built-in function information
BuiltInFunctions.main(Array())
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code generates a JSON file containing information about built-in functions in the Alephium project and writes it to a specific location.

2. What is the format of the JSON file generated by this code?
   - The JSON file contains an array of objects, where each object represents a built-in function and contains information such as its name, category, signature, documentation, parameters, and return type.

3. What is the significance of the `BuiltInFunctions` object and the `FunctionInfo` case class?
   - The `BuiltInFunctions` object contains the main logic for generating the JSON file, while the `FunctionInfo` case class defines the structure of the objects that will be included in the JSON array.
